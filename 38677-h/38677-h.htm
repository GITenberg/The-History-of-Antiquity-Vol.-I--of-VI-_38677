<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<h3>TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</h3>


<p>Fifty years ago, the opinion was held by some that
we could watch, in the tradition of the most ancient
realms of the East, the first awkward steps in the
childhood of the human race, while others believed
that it was possible to discover there the remnants
of an original wisdom, received by mankind at the
beginning of their course immediately from the hand
of heaven. The monuments of the East, subsequently
discovered and investigated by the combined labour
of English, German, and French scholars, have added
an unexpected abundance of fresh information to the
Hebrew Scriptures and the narratives of the Greeks,
which, till then, were almost our only resource. No
one can any longer be ignorant that Hither Asia at
a very remote period was in possession of a rich and
many-sided civilisation. The earliest stages of that
civilisation in the valley of the Nile, of the Euphrates
and the Tigris, on the coasts and in the interior of
Syria are, it is true, entirely hidden from our
knowledge; even the far more recent culture of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>Aryan tribes we can only trace with the help of the
Veda and the Avesta back to the point at which
they were already acquainted with agriculture, and
possessed considerable artistic skill.</p>

<p>Our object in regard to the ancient East is not
to retrace the beginning of human civilization, but
rather to understand and establish the value and
extent of those early phases of civilisation to which
the entire development of the human race goes back.
The way to this aim is clearly sketched out for us.
A minute comparison of tradition with the results of
the successful advance of Oriental studies, a conscientious
examination of the one by the other, opens out
to us the prospect of discerning more precisely the
nature of those ancient constitutions and modes of
life.</p>

<p>To this purpose I have undertaken to contribute
by a descriptive treatment of the subject. Such an
attempt appeared to me indicated by the consideration
that the fragments of our knowledge&mdash;and more
than fragments we do not at present possess, and
never shall possess, even though we assume that the
number of monuments be considerably increased&mdash;if
conscientiously brought together, would produce
the most effective impression by exhibiting the
connection of all the various sides of those ancient
civilisations&mdash;and if to this collection were added
the conclusions that can be drawn from it and
from the monuments about the political life, the
religion, the manners and laws, the art and trade
of those nations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>
<p>How to offer in a general survey the sum total
of these fragments of the ancient East is a problem
attended with difficulties which I have felt at every
step in my work. There are not many corner-stones
immovably fixed; the outlines are often to be drawn
with a wavering pen; the unavoidable explanations of
the gaps to be filled up admit of a variety of opinions.
Hence it is often&mdash;only too often&mdash;necessary to
interrupt the narrative by comments, in order to
support the view taken by the author, or refute
other views, or arrive at the conclusion that there
is no sufficient evidence for a final decision. The
best mode of remedying these disagreeable interruptions
was first to state the tradition, which is
generally closely connected with the peculiar nature
of the people whose fortunes it narrates, and if not
actually true, is nevertheless characteristic of the
manners and views of the nation, and then to examine
this tradition in and by itself, and in conjunction
with the monuments; to state the opposite
interpretations; and, finally, to give the results thus
obtained. In this way narrative and investigation
are combined in such a manner that the reader is
enabled to pursue the inquiry. The data and the
critical examination of them, and lastly the results
obtained, are put before him for his own decision.</p>

<p>The objections, made of late to the results of
Assyrian researches, touch certain points only, in
which over-hasty conclusions have prematurely declared
the enigma to be solved. Whatever doubts
may still remain, I have felt the more confidence in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>following the main results, because wherever Asshur
and Israel come into contact the Hebrew Scriptures
agree with the records of the kings of Asshur.
Who could understand the meaning of the verses of
Nahum (iii. 8-10), of the fate of "No-Ammon, to
whose aid came Ethiopians, Arabians, and Libyans,"
till G. Smith discovered the document of Assurbanipal
relating to the capture of Thebes? Who
could explain the words of Ezekiel about the grave
of Elam (xxxii. 27) till the tiles of Babylonia and
Assyria told us of the ancient supremacy and power
of this kingdom, and of its battles with the Assyrians,
and subjugation by their arms? If, in chronology,
I have given the preference to the tablets of the
Assyrian Archons over the Books of Kings, I have
done so, not because I hold the former to be infallible,
but because the chronological dates in the Books of
Kings prove, by more than one contradiction, that
they have not come down to us intact.</p>

<p>My narrative embraces those independent civilisations
of the ancient East which came to exercise a
mutual influence on each other. First we follow
the realm on the Nile and the kingdoms of Hither
Asia as far as the point where the nations of Iran
began to influence their destinies. Then I attempt
to set forth the peculiar development of the Aryan
tribes in the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges,
down to the times of Tshandragupta and Asoka.
Then follows the history of the Bactrians, the Medes,
and the Persians, until the period when the nations
of the table-land of Iran were united by Cyrus and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>Darius with the countries of Western Asia, when
Aryan life and Aryan civilisation gained the supremacy
over the whole region from Ceylon to the Nile
and the Hellespont. The forms of life at which the
great empires of Asia had arrived are finally brought
face to face with the more youthful civilisation
attained by the Hellenes in their mountain cantons.
This new development we follow down to the first
great shock when East and West met in conflict, and
the Ach&aelig;menids sought to crush the Hellenes under
the weight of Asia. With the failure of this attempt
my history of the ancient world concludes.</p>

<h3>THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE.</h3>


<p>History knows nothing of her infancy. The beginning
of the development of the human race lies
beyond the sphere of memory, and so also do the
first steps in that development. The early stages of
culture&mdash;whether in nations or individuals&mdash;are unconscious,
and unobservant of self; they are therefore
without the conditions which make remembrance
possible. The original forms of social life in the
family and in the tribe, the movement of wandering
hunters and shepherds, the earliest steps in agriculture,
could leave behind them neither monuments nor
records. It is true no gifted or favoured nation, which
has raised itself above these beginnings to civic life and
independent culture, has neglected to cast a backward
glance upon the history of its past. Everywhere
the attempt has been made to present the past from
the later point of culture. Whether the memory
reaches but a little way, or goes back far into the past,
it is always enriched by ideas taken from religious conceptions,
or national pride, from reflection or theory.
Such reconstructions are significant of the nature and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>character of the people for whom they replace the
history of their youth, but they have no claim to
represent the actual course of their development. The
case is different when the growing culture of a people
is observed by nations already at a higher grade of
civilisation. The Romans were in a position to leave
behind a picture of the youthful German tribes; the
Byzantines could inform us of the movements of the
Slaves; modern Europe could observe the tribes of
America, the nomadic shepherds of Asia, and the
islanders of the South Sea from a higher and riper
point of development.</p>

<p>The oldest kingdoms of which tradition and monuments
preserve any information passed unobserved
through the earliest stages of their culture. Tradition
and the earliest monuments present them already in
the possession of a many-sided and highly-developed
civilisation. In what way these nations, the oldest
representatives of the culture of mankind, arrived
at their possession, we can only deduce from such
evidence as is before us anterior to tradition and
independent of it&mdash;from the nature of the regions
where these civilisations sprung up, from the physical
character and constitution of the nations which
developed them, from their languages and their
religious ideas.</p>

<p>The history of antiquity is the description of the
forms of culture first attained by the human race.
If it is impossible to discover the origin of these
forms historically, and the attempt is made to indicate
their preliminary stages, so far as the recorded
elements allow connected conclusions, it becomes the
chief object of such a history to recover from the
fragments of monuments and tradition the culture
of the ancient East, and of the Hellenes so closely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
connected with the East: to reconstruct from
isolated relics and myths the image of that rich
and ample life which filled the East in religion and
state, in art and industry, in research and commerce,
in political struggles and intense religious devotion,
long before the time when Solon gave laws to the
Athenians, and the army of Cyrus trod the shore of
the &AElig;gean Sea.</p>

<p>The oldest civilisation, the oldest state grew up on
that quarter of the globe which seems least favourable
to the development of mankind. On either side of the
equator, Africa stretches out in huge land-locked
masses. A vast table-land occupies the whole south
of the continent, and in the north sinks down to a
plain more impassable even than the broad seas which
wash the coasts of Africa on the west, south, and east.
This plain&mdash;the bed of a dry sea&mdash;lies in the burning
sun without vegetation. Only where springs water
the thirsty soil do fruitful islands rise out of the
moving sand, the lonely waste of ravines, the craggy
ridges, and bald platforms of rock.</p>

<p>As the sea nowhere indents the coasts of Africa with
deep bays, the rivers cannot excavate broad and
fruitful valleys, and provide means of access to the
interior. The high table-land is surrounded by a
steep rampart of mountains, which descend in terraces
to the coast, and here, almost without exception, leave
narrow strips of low and marshy land. Through the
barrier drawn around them by this rampart the rivers
must force their path in a violent course, in waterfalls
and rapids, in order to fall into the sea after a short,
and proportionately more sluggish course through the
narrow strip on the shore.</p>

<p>The table-land, its rampart of mountains, and the
long lines of coast, are, with the exception of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
southern apex and the Alpine territory of Abyssinia
in the east, the dwelling-places of the black race&mdash;the
negro. However great the number of negro
nations and tribes, however much they differ in
physical form and in dialect&mdash;living as they do
beneath a vertical sun, in regions difficult of access&mdash;they
have never risen beyond the infancy of human
civilisation&mdash;a rude worship of gods. Wherever they
have not been powerfully affected by the introduction
of foreign elements, generation has followed generation
without remembrance or essential alteration.</p>

<p>The north coast of Africa is of a different character
to the rest of the continent. While the western coast
looks to the broad Atlantic Ocean, and the waves
which break on the southern apex lead to the ice of
the pole, the north coast is separated from the neighbouring
shores by a basin of moderate extent. It is
a mountainous district which fills up the space between
the Sahara and the Mediterranean. Towards
the west the peaks of Atlas reach, even in
this climate, to the region of eternal snow; on the
east, towards the mouths of the Nile, the hills
gradually sink down, and the plain of Barca rises
little more than 1,000 feet above the sea level.
Numerous chains of hills, at one time pressing
close upon the sea, at another leaving more extensive
plains upon the coast, cover the northern edge, which
along the deep valleys of the mountain streams
exhibits that vigorous and luxuriant vegetation so
characteristic of Africa when not checked by want
of water, although even these fruitful valleys are
again in their turn broken by droughty, and therefore
bare, table-lands and depressions.</p>

<p>On this northern coast, toward the Mediterranean,
opens the valley which, in extent of fruitful territory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
is the largest in the whole continent. It occupies the
north-east corner of Africa, which is only separated
from Arabia by a narrow strip of sea, and carries its
gleaming waters through the wide space from the
subsidence of the table-land down to the coast, where
for almost its whole remaining breadth the continent
is filled up with the desert of Sahara.</p>

<p>From the north-east spur of the table-land, out of
vast lakes (Ukerewe), fed from the glaciers and snows
of huge mountains lying under the equator, and passing
through the lower lake Mwutan, flows the western
arm of the Nile, the White Nile, Bahr-el-Abiad.
After bursting through the terraces of the mountain,
it reaches, at the foot, a woody morass, filled with
thickets of tamarisks and sycamores, of bamboo and
reeds and tall creepers, inhabited by the elephant
and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus and the crocodile,
the zebra and hyena, by antelopes and snakes. Then
the stream passes into broad savannas, covered here
and there with tropic forests, and while flowing
through a mountainous district of moderate elevation,
it unites with the eastern arm, the Blue Nile, Bahr-el-Azrak,
which, rising further to the east out of the
Abyssinian plateau, brings down a far smaller bulk of
water from the Alpine glades of the snowy mountain
Samen. Combined into one stream, these waters flow
through a broad expanse of rock and desert, covered
with conical stones of volcanic origin. The lines of
hills running parallel to the terraces of the mountain
rampart lie athwart the river; and through this barrier
it breaks in numerous cataracts. Only in the depressions
between them can the soil, refreshed with
water, support vegetation. Finally, at Syene the Nile
passes through the last cataract. Henceforward the
structure of the mountains is changed. A fissure in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the rock about 750 miles long opens on the
Mediterranean; and through this the mighty river&mdash;at
the last cataract it is 3,000 feet in breadth&mdash;can
flow onward in undisturbed peace to the ocean.</p>

<p>Out of this fissure the Nile has created a narrow
strip of fruitful soil&mdash;the valley is not more than three
or four hours in breadth on an average&mdash;which is
secured by the heights on the west from the moving
sand and the storms of the great desert, and is
separated by the mountain on the east from the
rocky crags, the desolate flats, and sandy dunes
which fill up the space between the valley of
the river and the Red Sea. To this valley the
mighty river not only gives a refreshing coolness
and moisture by the mass of its waters, it fertilises
and manures it from year to year by its overflow.
At the summer solstice, when the snow on the
peaks of the lofty mountains, in which the two arms
of the Nile take their rise, is melting, and the tropical
rains fall upon its upper course, the waters of the
river slowly and gradually rise. Towards the end of
July it passes over the banks and overflows the
whole valley as far as the enclosing lines of hills,
so that towards the end of September it stands
more than twenty feet above the lowest water level.
Falling as gradually as it rose after more than four
months it sinks back to the ordinary level. Wherever
the overflowing waters have covered the land, there
is left behind a fertilising mud or slime. This is
the soil which the two rivers before uniting have
washed from the upper hills. Carried down by the
stream, it is deposited by the gentle flow of the waters
on the surface of the valley. The refreshment of the
earth by the inundation, the fertilisation by this slime,
and the cooling of the air by the immense body of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
water, are the essential advantages which Egypt owes
to her river, and hence, even as early as Herodotus,
Egypt seemed to be the gift of the Nile. The watering
of the soil and the cooling of the air just in the
very hottest months of the year, are the more invaluable
because the blue and gleaming sky of the
upper valley is never darkened by rain clouds, while
the heat is severe, and the storms from the south-west
occasionally carry the sand and the dust over the
Libyan hills into the Nile. In the Delta, the region
along the lowest course of the Nile, showers occasionally
rise from the neighbouring sea; and through eight
months of the year the whole valley opening on the
Mediterranean is fanned by refreshing winds from
the north, which also facilitate navigation against
the stream.</p>

<p>This river-valley, the like of which in nature and
formation is not to be found in the whole globe,
offered in its seclusion a peculiarly favoured spot.
It was a small green oasis of luxuriant fertility and
grateful coolness in the midst of boundless deserts.
The dwellers in a land whose soil was every year
newly manured by nature, which brought forth
abundantly almost without labour, must very soon
have abandoned a pastoral life for agriculture, and in
consequence have acquired fixed abodes and settled
possessions. But the yearly inundation compelled
them also at an early period to protect their flocks
from the water, to secure their habitations, to observe
the periods of the rising and falling of the stream.
The long duration of the overflow made it necessary to
provide for the support of man and beast. They had
to learn how to carry on their dealings with each other
upon the water, when the whole valley was still filled
with the river, and to mark out firmly the limits of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
plots, so that they might again take possession of them
after the inundation. In Nubia the cataracts stopped
the navigation of the river, and the lines of rock and
strips of desert made intercourse difficult, and confined
the life of the tribes within the limits of the native
valley to their separate possessions. In Egypt, within
the two lines of hills, land and river created no
hindrance. A region so concentrated could not but
carry the tribes beyond the limits of separate existence;
the very land forced them to live a life more in
common. There was only a slight natural distinction
between the more secluded upper valley and the lower
opening in the Delta about the mouths of the Nile; and
this could merely have a stimulating effect upon the
development of culture, without interfering in any
way with its unity. Nevertheless the community of
life in the valley of the Nile was not caused solely
by the nature of the land. The tribes of the deserts
around this long and narrow oasis must have had all
the more lively a sense of the charm of the favoured
valley owing to the difficulty with which they procured
their own subsistence. Against these plundering
neighbours, and their attempts to force themselves into
the valley of blessing and abundance, the inhabitants
of Egypt had to combine their forces. They needed
a strong centralized command, a warlike monarchy,
to which here, earlier than elsewhere, the patriarchal
government of the tribes would therefore give way.</p>

<p>Egypt kept her inhabitants secluded within hard
and fast limits; beyond the hills began the desert.
With the increasing number of inhabitants the
attempt must have been made to set low-lying
marshy districts free from the excess of water, and
to make fruitful the higher parts of the valley beyond
the reach of the inundations by bringing the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
upon them. Experience quickly taught that the plot
produced the most abundant fruits on which the
inundation had continued longest, and consequently
had time to deposit the thickest layer of mud. Hence
the attempt was made to keep the water longer on
the soil by means of dykes. These objects, in regard
to which the interests of the several districts differed,
and which required the combination of large masses
of operatives to carry them out, must have made
the need of a supreme decisive and executive power
felt earlier in Egypt than in other lands.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Egypt found themselves surrounded
by a solemn landscape, before fixed and
unchanging forms and outlines, in the midst of
natural phenomena, recurring with invariable regularity
and always in the same succession. Such
surroundings and impressions must have stamped on
the young life of a ripening nation a settled, stern,
and unvarying character. When the original unity
and society of life, which comprises all members of the
family and in the tribe, has been broken through&mdash;when
at the beginning of their settled life some have
turned their attention to agriculture and cattle, others
to hunting and war, others again to the fulfilment of
religious duties&mdash;the sons are wont to carry on the
vocation of the fathers. This is the rule often in far
more advanced periods; and simpler conditions of life
compel the son to carry on the life of the father, in
whose occupation he has grown up. In such times
there is no mode of teaching and instruction but
through the family. In this way the tribes and the
nation part into separate circles, which carry on as an
inheritance the mode of life derived from their forefathers.
These divisions of occupation, of vocation,
and mode of life could be carried out earlier and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with greater sharpness in Egypt than in other
lands.</p>

<p>As life becomes more settled and developed, there
are always found families with an especial liking for
war. They are enriched by the spoil which is the
fruit of their bravery, and protect the agricultural and
pastoral part of their tribe from the attacks of
plunderers. Every nation gives willing honour to the
brave warriors among them, and gladly recognises the
superiority of a mode of life which puts life to
the risk over other occupations. And when, from
the early simple stage, in which every head of a
family approaches the gods with his offerings in trust
and confidence, religion has developed into a body of
usages and customs which must be performed and
followed out if any share is to be obtained in the
grace of the gods, the exact knowledge of these can
only be handed down from father to son. And if the
mass of the population gives honour to the warriors,
how much more readily will it bow down before those
who, by their prayers, libations, and offerings, can
bring them the fruits of the field and the blessing of
the gods&mdash;protection in this world and salvation in
the next! Moreover, if the families of warriors and
priests, filled with the conviction of their own higher
worth, disdain the occupations of the rest of the
people; if they are convinced that they are of a
better kind than the rest, that only from the noble
and good can the noble and good arise&mdash;that
better blood gives better feelings, and better birth
better men&mdash;then in this feeling, so natural to a
primitive era, they allow their occupation to be
shared only by those who belong to their race; they
take wives from their own class only, not from others;
they give their daughters in marriage to their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
people only. Thus the various modes of life and orders
which naturally come into existence end in castes.</p>

<p>The more fruitful the land of Egypt, the richer the
products of the soil, and the more frequent the necessity
of repelling the plundering inroads of the desert
tribes, the more rapidly did the distinction between
the agricultural and military orders spring up. And
the greater the pride with which the inhabitants of
this favoured land might and did look down upon the
miserable tribes of the desert, the more grateful were
the looks turned towards the gods, who had given
them so beautiful and productive a land in the midst
of the desert, who supplied them with water, fertilised
their soil, cooled the heat of the atmosphere and gave
them life and plenty, while all around them reigned
desolation and death. To these beneficent powers the
inhabitants of the valley of the Nile could not refuse
an earnest service of thanksgiving for blessings so rich
and so ceaselessly renewed; by their piety they had
also to provide that the gods would graciously preserve
these blessings to them. It is obvious that a
tone and feeling like this, arising in the population
from the very nature of the land, must have been in a
high degree conducive to the rise of a priestly order
in Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt had excellent natural boundaries. If the
forces of the land were once united in a single hand,
there could be no difficulty in repelling the tribes of
the desert. Thenceforward there would be little
reason to fear an enemy on this side of the boundary
hills. No rival power could arise in the neighbouring
deserts, and should any victorious state arise at a
distance, the deserts checked the advance of their
armies. It was much more probable that the united
forces of the river-valley should subjugate the tribes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the surrounding desert. Hence the position of their
land allowed the inhabitants of the valley to develop
undisturbed. The culture once obtained could be
quietly transmitted to others, and constantly extended.
This circumstance, in connection with the domestic
peace of the country under a monarchy, allowed the
priesthood to extend their lore in unbroken tradition
from generation to generation, while quietly amassing
stores of knowledge; and with the increase of the
population all the hands not required for agriculture&mdash;and
in Egypt this claims but a small amount of
labour&mdash;had to devote themselves to trade and manufacture.
And even these arts were likely to attain
the greater excellence in so far as the artisans and
tillers of the ground were less disturbed by war and
military service. The more distinct the boundaries
of the land, the less to conquer and occupy outside
them, the more industrious, amid the growing population,
must have been the culture of the ground
and the irrigation of it, the more actively must the
artisans have pursued their trade, and industry must
have developed with a greater vigour as the number
of mouths requiring food increased.</p>

<p>So far as our knowledge reaches, the northern
edge of Africa, like the valley of the Nile as far as
the marshes at the foot of the Abyssinian hills, was
inhabited by nations who in colour, language, and
customs were sharply distinguished from the negro.
These nations belong to the whites: their languages
were most closely allied to the Semitic.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From this,
and from their physical peculiarities, the conclusion
has been drawn that these nations at some time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
migrated from Asia to the soil of Africa. They
formed a vast family, whose dialects still continue
in the language of the Berbers. Assisted by the
favourable conditions of their land, the tribe which
settled on the Lower Nile quickly left their kinsmen
far behind. Indeed the latter hardly rose above a
pastoral life. The descendants of these old inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, in spite of the
numerous layers which the course of centuries has
subsequently laid upon the soil of the land, still
form the larger part of the population of Egypt,
and the ancient language is preserved in the dialect
of the Copts.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<i>ha-ka-ptah</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the precinct of Ptah." As Ptah was more especially
the god of Memphis, this name would have come from Memphis. The
attempt has been repeatedly made to derive the civilisation of Egypt
from Ethiopia and Meroe. But the problem of the origin of a given
civilisation is not solved by removing it from the locality where it exists
in full bloom to another, and as a rule more unknown, district. In the
case before us this assumption is met by the peculiar difficulty, that the
culture of Egypt is influenced essentially by the nature of the land, and
therefore can hardly have had an external origin. It cannot be removed
from a highly favoured locality into a district extremely hot, and fruitful
only in detached oases, without making the explanation of its origin much
more difficult. Moreover, the lower valley of the Nile has always ruled
over the upper: even in medi&aelig;val and modern times. The inscriptions
of Sargon, king of Assyria (722-705 <small>B.C.</small>), mention the king of Meroe
(Miluhhi); those of Sennacherib (705-681 <small>B.C.</small>) tell us, "The kings of
Egypt have summoned the archers, the chariots, the horses of the king of
Miluhhi." The inscriptions of Esarhaddon (681-668 <small>B.C.</small>) speak of the
"King of Egypt and Miluhhi," whom they also name "King of Egypt
and Cush;" and the successor of Esarhaddon directed his first campaign
against "Tarku" (Thirhaka) "of Egypt and Miluhhi." The word Meroe,
therefore, as the name of a kingdom lying above Egypt on the Nile, must
have been in use in Syria, even in the eighth century <small>B.C.</small> Hence
the Greeks denote by this name an island, and also a city of the Upper
Nile. According to Herodotus (2, 29) the great city Meroe, "which
ought to be the chief city of the rest of the Ethiopians" (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of those
of whom the Egyptians were not the immediate neighbours), was forty
days' journey and twelve days' sail (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> over 15,000 stadia) above Syene.
Later authorities, Eratosthenes, Artemidorus, Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy
reduce the distance by nearly one-half; they regard the distance between
Meroe and Syene as nearly equal to the distance from Syene to Alexandria,
and fix the whole distance from Alexandria to Meroe at 10,000 to 12,000
stadia. As the town and island of Meroe must be south of the junction
of the Astaboras (Atbara), (Strabo, p. 786), we must look for the island
between the Atbara and the Blue Nile, and for the city in the ruins at
the modern Begerauieh. Yet the chief town of the kingdom of Meroe,
when it takes an active part in history, is not Begerauieh. King
Thirhaka's residence lay near the modern Meraui under Mount Barkal.
The name in inscriptions is Neb, and, consequently, in Greek and Latin
Napata. Even under the Sesurtesen and Amenemha, Egypt ruled over
Nubia as far as Semne and Kumna, under Amenophis III. as far as
Soleb, and under Ramses II. as far as Mt. Barkal. The oldest ruins at
this spot belong to a temple dedicated by this king to Ammon (Lepsius,
"Reisebriefe," s. 238); next come the ruins of the buildings of Thirhaka,
which differ as little from Egyptian buildings as those which he and his
two Ethiopian predecessors erected in Egypt. Moreover, the later ruins
found at Napata, especially some twenty small pyramids, are feeble imitations
of Egyptian art. The same character of imitation is stamped upon
the monuments of Begerauieh, though here it is mingled with foreign
elements. This place, further removed from Egypt, and therefore more
secure, was beyond doubt the residence of the kings of Meroe, at least
from the time of Cambyses, and it was named after the country. Herodotus
points out that Zeus and Dionysus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Osiris, were worshipped
here, and that the oracle of Zeus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Ammon, extended its authority
over the Ethiopians: the further accounts which Diodorus preserves of this
priesthood give a poor idea of their cultivation (3, 3 ff. Strabo, pp. 827,
828). At the time of the second Ptolemy, this priesthood was destroyed
by the King, Ergamenes, whose name (Arkamen) Lepsius has discovered
on ruins at Mt. Barkal, as well as Begerauieh, and an independent monarchy
was established. Hence we must entirely give up the idea of deriving the
supposed supremacy of the priesthood in Egypt, a supremacy which never
existed here, from the priesthood formed at Begerauieh after the time of
Thirhaka and Psammetichus (in the days of Psammetichus, Herodotus
tells us that a king of the Ethiopians received strangers without an oracle,
and gave them land, 2, 30); that is, in the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>, which continued
to exist till 250 <small>B.C.</small> Still less reason is there to suppose that
the so-called Indian supremacy of the priesthood came through Meroe
into Egypt. Rather we may feel ourselves justified in assuming that the
elements of civilisation which took root on the middle Nile passed from
Egypt to that district. In the inscriptions of Begerauieh the name Meroe
occurs as Meru, and Merua, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "White rock"; Lepsius, <i>l. c.</i> 205-232.
As the banks of the Nile, here and also at Mt. Barkal, consist of whitish-yellow
chalk rocks, the name of the land and its southern metropolis, of
which the existence since the sixth century <small>B.C.</small> is demonstrated, may
have been named from this peculiarity of the land.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE ANTIQUITY OF THE CIVILISATION IN THE VALLEY<br />
OF THE NILE.</h3>


<p>In the eighteenth century <small>B.C.</small>, according to their
reckoning, the tradition of the Hebrews presents us
with a complete picture of court and civic life in the
valley of the Nile, and it tells us of the building of
cities in the east of the Delta, which, according to the
same computation, must have been founded about the
year 1550 <small>B.C.</small> The Homeric poems contain accounts
of the land of &AElig;gyptus, of the fair-flowing Zeus-born
river of the same name, of the very beautiful fields and
cities of Egypt, of princes who fought from their
chariots, and finally of "Egyptian Thebes, where in the
palaces lie the greatest treasures; a city with a hundred
gates, from each of which go forth two hundred men
with horses and chariots." They also add "that the
fruitful earth bears abundance of drugs in Egypt,
some mingled for good, others for evil, and there every
one is a physician and has acquaintance with men;
they are all sprung from the god of healing."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>According to the account given by the Greeks
the Egyptians boasted to be the oldest of mankind,
and to possess the most ancient traditions.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
priests believed that they could compute the history
of Egypt by thousands of years. When Herodotus
was in Egypt about the middle of the fifth century
<small>B.C.</small>, the priests at Thebes read to him from a
book the names of 331 kings who had reigned from
Menes, the first ruler of Egypt, and the founder of
Memphis, down to Moeris inclusive; among these
were eighteen Ethiopians, and one queen; the rest
were Egyptians. After Moeris came Sesostris, Pheron,
Proteus, Rhampsinitus, Cheops and Chephren, Mycerinus,
Asychis, Anysis, Sabakon, and Sethos, so that
from Menes to Sethos 341 kings had reigned over
Egypt in as many generations. Herodotus remarks
that the priests assured him that they had an accurate
knowledge of what they said, for the years were
always enumerated and put down. To convince him
they carried him into the great temple at Thebes
and showed him there 345 wooden colossi of the chief
priests who had presided over the temple through as
many generations, in regular succession from father to
son; for every chief priest placed his statue here
during his own life-time. Before these kings and
chief priests the gods had ruled over Egypt; first
the Eight Gods, then the Twelve, then Osiris the
Greek Dionysus, after him Typhon, and, last of all,
Horus. From the time of King Amasis (570-526
<small>B.C.</small>) to the time of Osiris 15,000 years had passed,
but from the time of the Twelve Gods to Amasis
17,000 years.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus does not conceal the doubts raised in his
mind by the high antiquity claimed in these accounts
by the priests. He found an especial difficulty in
the fact that Dionysus Osiris, who, according to his
computation, was born 1,600 years at the most before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his own time (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about 2050 <small>B.C.</small>), must have lived
more than 15,000 years earlier, according to the assertion
of the Egyptians. By their account 341 kings
reigned from Menes to Sethos; and on this basis
Herodotus reckoned the duration and commencement
of the Egyptian kingdom. He took 33&#8531; years as the
length of a generation, and thus Menes must have
begun to reign 340 generations, or 11,340 years
before the accession of Sethos. Further, Herodotus
placed over 150 years between the accession of Sethos
and the death of Amasis, and thus according to his
data we get the enormous total of 11,500 years for
the duration of the Egyptian kingdom from Menes
till its overthrow by the Persians. Menes therefore
must have ascended the throne before the year
12000 <small>B.C.</small>; the rule of Osiris commenced 15500 <small>B.C.</small>;
and that of the Twelve Gods 17500 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>If we leave the gods out of the question, and reduce
the length of a generation, which Herodotus has put
too high, to its real average of twenty-five years,
the 340 generations with those of Sethos, Psammetichus,
Necho, Psammetichus II., Apries, and Amasis,
make up 8,650 years, and since the Persians took
Egypt in 525 <small>B.C.</small>, the beginning of the reign of
Menes still falls in the year 9175 <small>B.C.</small> This incredible
fact is not made more credible because Plato represents
an Egyptian priest asserting to Solon that the annals
of Sais reached back 8,000 years; or speaks in
the "Laws" of works of Egyptian art, ten thousand
years old.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Four hundred years after Herodotus, Diodorus
travelled to Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He tells that, according to some
fabulous accounts, gods and heroes first ruled over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Egypt for something less than 18,000 years. The last
of these was Horus, the son of Isis. After these came
470 native kings, of whom the first was Menes, before
the time of the Macedonian and Persian rule, and also
four Ethiopian kings and five queens. The Ethiopians
did not immediately succeed each other, but at intervals,
and their united reigns amounted to a little less
than thirty-six years. "Of all these kings the priests
have sketches in their holy books, handed down
through successive generations from extreme antiquity,
showing how tall each king was, what he
was like, and what he accomplished in his reign." If
we place the reign of Menes 479 generations before
Cambyses, this computation, on the reckoning of
Herodotus, would place the accession of Menes in
the year 16492 <small>B.C.</small>; taking a shorter average length
for the generations, we may bring it to the year 12500
<small>B.C.</small> But Diodorus shows from other accounts that
this mode of computation is inadmissible. He tells
us that the priests of Egypt numbered about 23,000<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
years from the reign of Helius or Heph&aelig;stus, who,
according to other priests, was the first of the gods
to reign,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> till the entrance of Alexander into Asia
(334 <small>B.C.</small>). If of this total we allow about 18,000
years to the gods, the accession of Menes would have
to be placed about the year 5300 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>  But as Diodorus
also says that something less than 5,000 years
had elapsed since the first human king to his arrival
in Egypt, Menes' reign would fall about the year
5000 <small>B.C.</small> Diodorus fixes the accession of this king
even more closely when he remarks, in a third passage,
that the Egyptians assured him that, "for more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
4,700 years, kings, mostly natives, had ruled, and the
land had prospered greatly under them."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> With this
agrees the further account given by Diodorus, that
according to some the largest pyramid was built 3,400
years before his time. According to this Menes cannot
be carried back further than 4,800 years <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>If Menes founded the kingdom of Egypt 4,800
years <small>B.C.</small>, it continued for 4,275 years under native
kings; and if in this period 346 kings ascended the
throne, as Herodotus says, or 479, as Diodorus, the
average duration of each reign would be in the first
case more than twelve years, in the second less than
nine, which contradicts all credible history. The
lowest average of oriental reigns is fifteen years.</p>

<p>Still, from these accounts of Herodotus and Diodorus
it is clear that the priests of Egypt possessed lists of
the kings in long series, and that, according to their
view, gods and demigods had ruled over Egypt for
thousands of years before the earliest of these kings.
After Greek princes had ascended the throne of the
Pharaohs, and Egypt with its monuments and
writings was opened to the research of the Greeks,
Eratosthenes, who was the head of the library at
Alexandria in the second half of the third century
<small>B.C.</small>, studied the history of these old kings&mdash;at
"the royal request," as Georgius Syncellus tells
us&mdash;in the old annals and lists of the Egyptians, and
transcribed these lists in the Hellenic language.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This
compilation of Eratosthenes contained the names and
reigns of thirty-eight kings of Thebes. Syncellus
repeats the list, and adds: "Here ended the rule of
the thirty-eight kings who were called Theban in
Egypt, whose names Eratosthenes collected out of
the sacred books of Thebes and translated into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Hellenic language. The names of the fifty-three
Theban kings who followed these have been also
preserved by Apollodorus; but we consider it superfluous
to add them, for even the list of the first is of
no use."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Thus the researches of the Alexandrine
Greeks had brought together a list of ninety-one kings,
ninety successors of Menes, out of the writings of
the priests of Thebes. As early as the time of
Eratosthenes the Egyptians assisted the researches
of the Greeks. About the middle of the third century
<small>B.C.</small>, that is, in the time of the second and third
Ptolemy, an Egyptian named Manetho (<i>Ma-n-thoth</i> =
"loved by Thoth"), of Sebennytus, and apparently
scribe to the temple at Thebes,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> composed in Greek
a work on the history of Egypt in three books.
"Obviously possessed of Hellenic culture"&mdash;so we find
it in Josephus&mdash;"Manetho wrote the history of his
country in Greek, translating it, as he tells us,
from the sacred writings; he undertook to interpret
Egyptian history from the sacred writings."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This
work of Manetho was lost at an early period; all
that remains is the list of the dynasties, a third part
of the names of the kings, and a few fragments; and
even these remnants we possess only in excerpts by a
second or third hand. Manetho begins his history of
Egypt with the rule of the gods. First came Ptah,
the creative god of light, and the great gods, then the
demigods, and Manes. After these had ruled over
Egypt for 24,857 Egyptian years, according to the
excerpt of Africanus, that is for 24,820 Julian years,
the rule of human kings begins with Menes, and these
continued through thirty dynasties for 5,366 years.
As Manetho closes his list of the kings of Egypt with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the last year of Nectanebos, who rebelled against
Artaxerxes Ochus&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> with the year 340 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;Menes
must have founded the kingdom in the year 5706 <small>B.C.</small>,
or rather, if we reduce the Egyptian years of Manetho's
reckoning to Julian years, in the year 5702 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
This statement carries us back to a far less remote
antiquity than the computation of the date of Menes
by 346 generations previous to Cambyses; on the
other hand, it goes 900 years higher than the date
which we deduced from Diodorus.</p>

<p>What amount of authority should be ascribed to
the lists of Manetho? Did the priests really possess
sketches of kings and accounts of their reigns reaching
back more than 5,000 years? In order to believe this,
must we not allow that at such a remote time as the
reign of Menes, or soon after it, writing was known and
in use in Egypt? And granting this, must not the first
beginning of culture in Egypt be carried back at least
500 years before Menes? Moreover, the lists do not
correspond with the number of the kings given by
Herodotus, or by Diodorus. Herodotus, as we said,
put 346 generations before the time of Cambyses,
Diodorus gave 479 kings before the same date. The
excerpt of Africanus from Manetho, even if we substitute
the smaller numbers given in the excerpt of
Eusebius in all the dynasties, of which only the total
sum of the rulers is stated, still gives us 388 kings
from Menes to Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> If these discrepancies
awaken the suspicion that the number and the succession
of the kings was not agreed upon even by the
priests themselves, the suspicion is increased by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
fact that the lists do not tally in the various excerpts in
which they have come down to us. What weight can be
given to a list which, in the excerpt from Africanus,
allows 953 years (or 802 at the least) to the rule of the
Hyksos, and in the excerpt of Eusebius allows 103
years, and again 511 years in the excerpt of Josephus?
Still greater discrepancies appear if we compare the
list of Eratosthenes with the names and numbers
handed down to us from Manetho's work. Both lists
begin with Menes; both allow him a reign of sixty-two
years; but Eratosthenes describes his thirty-eight
kings as of Theban origin or race, while in Manetho
the first Theban dynasty began to reign 2,240 years
after Menes.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Nevertheless the names of the first
three or four rulers in Eratosthenes agree with those
in Manetho. Then the coincidence breaks off till the
fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth names in Eratosthenes,
to which corresponding names are found in
Manetho's list, but in the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth,
and thirtieth places; and from this point to
the end of the list of Eratosthenes there are only two
or three names to which corresponding names are
found in Manetho, and these occur at far greater
intervals in the series. The last name in Eratosthenes
nearly corresponds to the name of the king, in
Manetho, under whom the invasion of the Hyksos
took place. If, therefore, we assume that the list of
Eratosthenes was intended to enumerate the kings
who ruled over Egypt to this date, we find thirty-eight
kings who must have reigned through 1076 years;
and, as parallel to these, we find in Manetho fourteen
dynasties with at least 241 kings, occupying a period
of 3,084 years.</p>

<p>Scarcely less striking are the contradictions in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
monuments themselves. In the temple of Ammon
at Karnak, which was extended on a magnificent
scale by Tuthmosis III. (1591-1565 <small>B.C.</small>),<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the king
is delineated twice in a colossal form on the back wall
of a chamber. Between the two pictures sit sixty-four
kings in four rows one over the other. The
inscription, "A royal offering for the kings of both
Egypts," as well as the position of Tuthmosis, shows
that he is offering prayer and sacrifice to his
predecessors in the kingdom. Of these sixty-four
kings, three are the immediate predecessors of
Tuthmosis, Tuthmosis I., II., and Amosis. Before
Amosis this table puts fifty-seven kings; the name of
Menes is wanting; but in Manetho's list there are
nevertheless no fewer than 284 kings,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> from Menes to
Amosis, with whom, in the excerpt of Africanus, the
eighteenth dynasty begins. In the great temple built
by Sethos I. (1439-1388, <small>B.C.</small>) at Abydus in honour
of Osiris, this prince, with his son Ramses, may
be seen on the wall of a passage offering prayer
and incense to his predecessors in the kingdom.
There are seventy-six shields with names, beginning
with the shield of Menes. The last is the shield
of Sethos, who in this way is represented as offering
prayer to himself, among the rest. Down to
Amenemha IV., the close of the twelfth dynasty
(2179-2171 <small>B.C.</small>), there reigned, according to
Manetho's list 104 kings, but the table of Sethos
gives sixty-five shields for the interval from Menes to
Amenemha IV. From this king to Sethos, the first
prince of the nineteenth dynasty, Manetho's list gives
193 kings, excluding the shepherd kings, whereas the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
table of Sethos shows only ten shields for this
interval.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Nothing in the way of explanation is to
be obtained from the monuments of this kind
belonging to the time of Ramses II. (1388-1322 <small>B.C.</small>)
On the wall of the portico between the first and second
court of the Ramesseum, the great temple built by
Ramses II. at Thebes, on the left bank of the Nile, there
is a picture in which the statues of thirteen predecessors
in the kingdom are carried in procession before the king.
There are eleven kings up to Amosis; before him is
the figure of Mentuophis; then Menes. In the little
temple built by Ramses II. at Abydus in honour of
Osiris, there is a tablet, on which Ramses is represented
offering adoration to the manes of his
predecessors. On this we can make out fifty shields,
but only about thirty are sufficiently uninjured to be
legible; so far as we can tell this table is only a
repetition of the table of Sethos in the great temple
of Abydus. A third series of the kings of this period
has been discovered in the tombs at Sakkarah. In
the tomb of Tunari, the kings' scribe and architect,
there is a representation of the sacrifice of Ramses II.
for the deceased kings of Upper and Lower Egypt.
Here we find fifty-seven shields; immediately before
Ramses II. is Sethos, Ramses I., and Horus, then six
illegible names; and before these Amosis. Before
Amosis are forty-six shields, of which the first can
perhaps be compared with the king mentioned in the
sixth place after Menes in Manetho's list.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The variations of these tables from the lists may
be explained by assuming that it depended on the
particular view and peculiar object of the kings who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
erected these monuments, which of their predecessors
they wished to honour, and which they wished to
exclude. But even a manuscript list of kings, which
has come down to us, exhibits numerous and very
considerable variations from Manetho's lists. This
list is a papyrus, now in Turin, supposed to belong to
the period 1500-1000 <small>B.C.</small> It begins with the rule
of the gods; then follow the names of the kings,
with the length of their reigns in years, months, and
days, down to the time of the Tuthmosis; and thus
it includes the first seventeen dynasties of Manetho's
list. It has been much damaged, and therefore we
can only discover that about 240 names were given,
of which, however, about 100 are entirely gone; and
of the others the lesser half at least is hardly legible.
As has been remarked, Manetho numbers at least
284 kings to the eighteenth dynasty. Moreover, the
papyrus does not agree with Manetho in the division
of the dynasties; at certain places, which do not
coincide with the sections of Manetho, totals are
given of the preceding reigns. The first king after
the gods is Mena (Menes), but of the names which
follow only a few agree with those in Manetho, and a
few more with those of the tables of Karnak, Abydus,
and Sakkarah.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But here also the same names occupy
different places in the series.</p>

<p>If in addition to all these variations and discrepancies
we add the fact that even in the contemporary
monuments and inscriptions which have come down
to us there is no lack of contradictions to Manetho's
statements&mdash;if too these monuments have not been
erected or preserved in sufficient continuity, nor are
of a sufficiently ample kind, to form an adequate check
upon the papyrus of Turin, or the tables of kings or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the list of Manetho&mdash;we must give up the hope of
ascertaining the antiquity and course of Egyptian
history on such data. One thing only comes out clear
and irrefragable from the tables of Karnak, Abydus,
and Sakkarah, no less than the Turin papyrus. Long
before Herodotus was in Egypt, long before Manetho
wrote his Egyptian history, in the fifteenth century
<small>B.C.</small> Menes was considered the first king of Egypt.
Even then lists of the kings were in existence, and
the priests had made a sketch of the history of their
land, in which the rule of the gods preceded the rule
of human kings.</p>

<p>Modern research has attempted in various ways to
find the key to the puzzle of these long and confused
series of kings made by the Egyptian priests.
Assuming that the names of the kings and the length
of their reigns, and the number of reigns belonging
to each dynasty, has been handed down correctly by
Manetho, but that some of these dynasties were
contemporaneous, the attempt has been made to
give such a selection from the dynasties of Manetho
as would supply a continuous thread for Egyptian
history. Thus from the dynasties expressly marked
as Memphitic, or Theban, a series may be formed
which shortens the calculation of Manetho by at least
1,000 years. We might proceed further in this
direction, and reduce Manetho's list by 2,000 or
3,000 years. According to the separate items in the
excerpts preserved, Manetho's thirty dynasties include
a series of 5,366 Egyptian years (from the year 5702
to the year 340 <small>B.C.</small>); nevertheless, Syncellus, in a
passage of his Chronology, has observed that the
whole period of history treated by Manetho in his
three books covered 3,555 years.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This observation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
has been used to prove that Manetho himself arranged
several dynasties contemporaneously; and thus, by
taking the whole total of years given by Syncellus
as a basis, the year 3892 <small>B.C.</small> has been fixed as
the first year of the reign of Menes. No doubt
a selection may be made from the dynasties of
Manetho in such a way that the sum total of the
reigns included in it will carry us no farther back
than this year.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But it is clear from the accounts
of Herodotus and Diodorus that the series of kings
made by the Egyptian priests were strictly successive;
and this fact is abundantly confirmed by the Turin
papyrus and the excerpts preserved from Manetho
himself. The 3,555 years which Syncellus brings
forward cannot, in the face of his own excerpt, be
taken as a number really derived from Manetho, and
with this number all the calculations founded upon it
fall to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>A second path, which has lately been struck out
for the reduction of Manetho's dynasties, is based
upon the list of Eratosthenes. The thirty-eight
kings enumerated in this list are placed beside the
first fourteen dynasties of Manetho. It is assumed
that only the names quoted in Eratosthenes are the
names of real monarchs, and that we must look for
similar names in the list of Manetho. By this assumption,
it is true, we are compelled to set aside several
of Manetho's dynasties, and even to throw away the
greater part of the kings of the dynasties which are
allowed to count in the series.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But even when we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
overcome all the difficulties in the way of this system,
we are still without the means to define accurately
the duration of the rule of the alien kings, which, as
has been already remarked, according to the various
excerpts from the list of Manetho, continued 953, or
511, or 103 years; nor is there any fixed point
immediately before the alien monarchy to enable us to
succeed in establishing the antiquity and commencement
of the Egyptian series of kings.</p>

<p>All attempts to arrive at the antiquity of the
civilisation and history of Egypt by these means are the
more doubtful, because in Egypt there is no fixed era
to form a basis for calculation. The time is reckoned
by the reigns of the kings. In such a case even the
most cautious inquiry of the priests could hardly have
arrived at a satisfactory chronology for the oldest
period. Though they had before them far more
numerous monuments than we have, and though the
lists of the various dominant families began to be
kept at a very early period, it was no longer possible
at the time when the lists of the Turin papyrus were
made out, to discover in what order the families
came, or which ruled contemporaneously before the
time of the alien kings. The mere arrangement of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>materials in the order of succession cannot fail to give
an entirely false picture of the history of Egypt, while
on the other hand the national pride of the Egyptians,
and the vanity of the priests, found a great satisfaction
in exaggerating the antiquity of their history by such
enumerations, even where it was known that any
families of kings were contemporaneous. With what
pride and complacency would they exhibit this endless
list of kings to the travelling strangers from Greece!</p>

<p>Besides the want of a fixed era, and the insufficient
knowledge of the ancient period, and of the alien
monarchy&mdash;besides the motives of national vanity,
there was another remarkable circumstance connected
with the priests of Egypt which was calculated to
lead them far away from historical truth. The
Egyptians measured time by a solar year of 360 days,
divided into twelve months of thirty days. It was
early observed that this year did not correspond to
the sun's orbit; and therefore five additional days
were added. The decisive event of the Egyptian year
was the inundation. The Nile began to rise at the
time of the summer solstice, and was coincident with
the rising of the Dog-star (Sothis), the brightest
star in the Egyptian sky. The Dog-star proclaimed
the approach of the inundation and the new fertilization
of the soil, and by proclaiming caused it. Thus
to the Egyptians this star Sothis was "the Lady of the
Beginning." The rising of the star denoted the new
year; which therefore must have begun on the 20th
July, the first of Thoth in the Egyptian calendar.
But since, in the Egyptian year, a quarter of a day
was wanting, in spite of the additional five years, to
make up the true astronomical year, the beginning of
every fourth year must have been a day in advance of
the true year, and the seasons, of which the Egyptians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
made three of four months each, the months, and the
festivals anticipated more and more the true time of
the year. This advance could not have escaped the
priests; they must soon have observed that a period
of 1,461 Egyptian years must elapse in order to
allow the Egyptian year to coincide with astronomical
time. For in 1,460 Egyptian years the
additional quarter of a day in the astronomical year
would amount to 365 whole days&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to an Egyptian
year; and at the end of this year the beginning of
the next was again coincident with the rising of the
Dog-star, as seen from Lower Egypt, and the commencement
of the inundation. Thus in a period of
1,461 years the year was again brought to its true
beginning.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Since the fruitfulness and life of the
Egyptian land depended on the inundation, and the
inundation began with the rising of the Dog-star, the
history of Egypt must also have begun with a similar
rising. If after 1,461 Egyptian years the rising of
the Dog-star again coincided with the beginning of the
civic year, the priests would regard this restoration of
the natural order as the completion of a great cycle of
events. The Dog-star brought the inundation, and with
it the fruits and life of Egypt. It was the awakener of
life. It must therefore have brought life to the world
also; time must have begun with the rising of Sirius.
Porphyrius tells us that to the Egyptians the rising of
the Dog-star was the beginning of the world.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the periods of the world must proceed according to a
number of periods fixed by the Dog-star. It seems that
the priests comprised the whole duration of the world
in twenty-five Sothis periods, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in 36,525 Egyptian
years. Regarded in this light, the Sothis periods of
the priests of Egypt must lead to a cyclic treatment of
their history, to which also the want of any definite
era was forcing them, while the antiquity and number
of the lists of kings offered abundant material for it.
The history of Egypt must comprise a definite number
of Sothis periods. It was known that in the fourteenth
century <small>B.C.</small> such a period ended, and a new
one commenced; the difficulty was to fill up two or
three periods anterior to this. Before the Sothis period
of the kings, the gods had ruled over Egypt, to whom,
therefore, a number of Sothis cycles, naturally more
extensive than those given to the rule of men, was
allotted. Thus the priests of Thebes were able to tell
Herodotus that, from the time when the Twelve Gods
ruled over Egypt, down to the days of King Amosis,
17,000 years had passed; that from Menes, down to
Sethos, 341 kings ruled in succession over Egypt, and
that in this space of time the sun had four times risen
in an unusual way&mdash;it had twice risen where it then
set, and had twice set where it then rose; and nothing
in Egypt had been changed by this, either in the gifts
of the earth or the river, in sickness or in mortality.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
This change of the rising and setting of the sun is
nothing more than the symbolical astrology of the
priests, who must have expressed the completion of
the movable solar year by the opposite quarters of
the sky; and it means no more than that two Sothis
periods had elapsed between Menes and Sethos; but
to Herodotus the statement as given naturally
appeared quite incredible.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> What the priests told
Herodotus, Manetho, following far older authorities,
had already fixed in a systematic form before
Diodorus found that the gods ruled 18,000 years,
and the human kings had begun to reign 4,700 years
before his arrival in Egypt. To the gods and demigods
Manetho allows twelve Sothis periods, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
17,520 Julian years. Then follows the history of
the men, the beginning of which Manetho places in
the commencement of that period of the Dog-star which
begins with the year 5702 <small>B.C.</small> From this point the
series of kings runs through three complete Sothis
periods down to Menephta; in the fourth period
Manetho closed the lists of his thirty dynasties with
the last native ruler in 340 <small>B.C.</small>, the 984th year of
the fourth Sothis period of the human kings. Thus
it would be possible to make the scheme clear on
which the priests of Egypt dealt with the history of
their land, and the lists of Manetho would then lay
claim to complete historical credibility for the ancient
periods in isolated items, though certainly not in
their combination as a whole.</p>

<p>With this result before us the only course open is
to seek for external evidence, and attempt to ascertain
the antiquity of the civilisation of Egypt independently
of the priests and their traditions. The first
fixed point in Egyptian chronology is given by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
campaign of Pharaoh Sisak against Judah and
Jerusalem. Sisak caused a sketch of his enterprise to
be delineated on the wall of a structure erected by him
in the temple at Karnak. According to Manetho's
list, Sisak (Sesonchis), the first ruler of his twenty-second
dynasty, begins his reign in the year 934 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
But the chronology of the Hebrews, which from the
establishment of the monarchy downwards coincides
within a few insignificant variations with the Assyrian
records, proves that Sisak must have been king in the
first half of the tenth century <small>B.C.</small> The campaign
against Judah falls in the middle of this century.
From Sisak to the expulsion of the Hyksos there was
an interval of at least 500 years, as we may maintain
approximately from the names of kings and their
reigns recorded on monuments. If therefore we
accept the excerpt from Manetho's history given in
Josephus (and that excerpt was made precisely for this
period, and has come down to us in the best shape),
and allow 511 years for the reign of the Hyksos, we
arrive at the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small> as the end of the old
monarchy. From this monarchy numerous monuments
have come down to us belonging to the
Amenemha, and Sesurtesen, the twelfth dynasty of
Manetho; and again to the time preceding these
princes belong the greatest monuments in Egypt, the
pyramids of Memphis, which, according to Manetho's
list, are the work of the fourth dynasty. These
pyramids therefore may have been built about the
year 2500 <small>B.C.</small> The plan and execution of these
monuments presuppose a very long practice in the
treatment and preparation of materials; the size,
permanence, and solidity of the construction were
impossible without great experience in the use of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
stone; and their massive form requires an acquaintance
with the principles of architecture which can
only be obtained in the course of centuries. And
independently of the advanced state of architecture
exhibited by these monuments at the first sight,
their erection is a proof of a condition of social and
civic life far removed from primitive tribal communities.
So long as tribes few in number and
isolated from each other possessed the valley of the
Nile, under the rule of their tribal chiefs, such structures
were impossible. They presuppose a settled
population, accustomed to work, and skilled in it.
And more than this. The whole population could
not any longer be occupied in agricultural work;
there must have been a considerable amount of superfluous
labour, living upon the productions obtained
from the earth by others. Such structures required
the united force of many thousands, the continued
efforts of long years. And as the use of complex
machinery for moving and raising the heavy
materials was unknown to the Egyptians, and remained
unknown, as we see from the monuments,
a still greater force of men and beasts of draught
were necessary to move such huge squares and blocks
by means of a simple lever and rollers. Finally, the
combination and continued employment of such forces
presupposes that society has been subordinated to a
superior direction and power, which could apply
those forces as it chose; in a word, it presupposes
an economical, political, and technical civilisation,
removed by at least 500 years from pastoral life and
patriarchal rule. If therefore we may assume that the
great pyramids were erected about the year 2500 <small>B.C.</small>,
the beginning of higher civilisation in the valley of the
Nile must not be placed later than the year 3000 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>This assumption is confirmed by the fact that the
oldest monuments of Egypt&mdash;and they are also the
oldest in the world&mdash;exhibit the Egyptians in possession
of the art of writing. All writing proceeds from
pictures. The writing of the Egyptians and Babylonians,
like that of the Chinese, Mexicans, and the
tribes of North America, was in the first instance no
more than speaking pictures. The Egyptians engraved
on the stone of their rocks pictures of the objects and
events of which they wished to preserve the remembrance.
As this use of pictures to assist the memory
became more common and more regular, from external
no less than internal reasons, it quickly acquired certain
abbreviations and combinations. The frequent
repetition of a picture led to its abbreviation. The
picture of a house dwindled into a square; water is
not so much sketched as indicated by waved lines;
instead of a forest we have the outline of a tree&mdash;in
Egypt we find the sycamore, the most common tree
in the country. Thus from actual imitative pictures
we arrive at indicatory pictures. But how could the
various kinds of fluid, for instance, be represented
in these indicatory pictures? The three waved lines
indicating water were retained, but beside them was
sketched a wine-jar or water-pot, and thus the desired
end was attained. By adding the picture of a god to
the square, a temple was distinguished from a house.
By such means the objects of the visible world could
be reproduced in pictures more or less abbreviated.
Even the actions and conditions of men which do
not come immediately under the eye could be represented
in this abbreviated metaphorical manner.
Giving could be represented by an outstretched arm
with a loaf; opening, by a door; going, by a road
planted with trees; travelling, by a walking bird;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
battle, by an arm equipped with shield and lance;
binding and fastening, by a coiled rope; destruction,
by a prostrate man. It was more difficult to represent
conditions which do not show themselves to the
eye, as, for instance, hunger and thirst. To express
thirst the Egyptians chose the symbol of water and
a calf running to it; hunger they represented by a
hand conveyed to the mouth, and this was also the
symbol of eating. But the most difficult task for
this picture-writing was the description of objects
transcending sense, and abstract ideas. For the gods,
it is true, popular notions and the fancy of the priests
had supplied fixed forms which only required to be
abbreviated for the picture-writing. The picture of
the sky-goddess served as a symbol for the sky.
The Egyptians regarded the sky as arched over the
earth; the feet of the goddess rested on one extremity,
and her hands on the other. Instead of the complete
figure of the goddess in this arched attitude, they
drew a line of a similar kind, and this was the
abbreviated picture of the sky. If the sun or a star
was combined with this line, the picture represented
the day and the night. But the abstract ideas of
law and justice, truth, protection, good, evil, life, &amp;c.,
could only be represented in this picture-writing by
sensuous images. In Egypt power was represented
by a brandished whip, or poleaxe; justice, by the
cubit, or symbol of equal measurement; good, by the
symbol of sound, in order perhaps to indicate harmony;
evil, by the picture of an unclean fish; truth,
by an ostrich feather&mdash;the feathers of this bird are
said to remain unchanged; protection, by a soaring
vulture, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Though the possession of such indicatory or
symbolic pictures enabled men to describe a series<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of objects and conditions, and even certain classes
of conceptions&mdash;this picture-writing was nevertheless
far removed from the expression of a definite and
intelligible speech. It was a great step in the
Egyptian writing when to their simple metaphorical
and symbolical pictures phonetic pictures were
added. From the actual picture by means of abbreviation,
by indicatory signs and symbols, they had
arrived at picture-signs, and had succeeded in expressing
a certain feeling by means of figures; but
now the indication of the sound was added to the
representation of the sense. The picture-writing could
only go to these picture-signs in order to borrow the
symbols for sound. Hence the sound A was denoted
by a symbol which signified an object of which the
name began with A; for this in Egypt the symbol of
an eagle (<i>achem</i>), or of a reed (<i>ak</i>), might be, and was
selected. Thus in order to express words which could
not be made plain by picture-signs and images of
sense, the plan was adopted of adding to the picture-signs
already in use for such words, one or more
phonetic symbols, a complete or incomplete phonetic
supplement. Hence arose a class of mixed pictures,
made up of the picture of the object, with the addition
of the sounds of the words of which the picture was
intended to express the meaning. To make the meaning
yet more clear, it was found necessary to add
key-signs, indicating the class and nature of the
word in question. Thus with the pictorial and
phonetic signs for day and hour was combined the
sign of the sun, and to the names of countries and
rivers the sign for land and water. Moreover these
key-signs showed whether the word symbolised by
a sound or a picture denoted an animal, a plant,
a kind of stone, or belonged to a particular class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of conditions and actions. Yet in this combination
of real and phonetic pictures, it always remained
uncertain whether a picture or symbol was to be
taken for its real meaning, or was to be regarded as
a phonetic symbol.</p>

<p>This, then, is the difficult writing of the Egyptians;
these are the hieroglyphics as presented even on those
great monuments. Even here we find this method of
writing applied in the same forms, and with the same
mixture of pictorial and phonetic signs, which it retained
in Egypt, with slight modifications (see below).
Without doubt, the development of this complicated
system was the work of centuries. In the infancy of
history, special insight and capability is obtained and
handed down only within the limits of certain circles.
There could be no regular application and development
of this system of writing before the formation of
a priestly order. And again, the separation of such
an order from the rest of the people could only take
place gradually; it must go through a number of
stages to raise it above the primitive conditions of
life. When this point of culture was reached, a considerable
space of time was still needed in order to
bring the picture-writing, even within the priestly
class, to the form in which we see it on the pyramids.
In those nations whose progress we can follow with
greater accuracy, centuries must pass before the indefinite
and floating notions entertained of the gods
are fixed in rigid forms. Yet in Egypt this change
had already taken place before the date of the oldest
hieroglyphics: for even in these we find typical
forms in use for the gods, with sharply drawn and
abbreviated outlines. In the picture-writing itself
there is a wide interval between the delineation of an
incident, or object, and the representation of a definite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
feeling; and a yet wider interval before the expression
of ideas, of definite speech, is attained. An advanced
stage of reflection and abstraction is required in order
to step from the picture of an occurrence to picture-signs
and images of sense, and again from these to
phonetic symbols. The symbols for an incident, and
for an idea and a sound, are separated by a wide
gulf. Independently of these internal requirements
for the advance of picture-writing, the external form
in which the oldest hieroglyphics are represented,
their even, harmonious, clearly-cut and unalterable
forms, are evidence not only of an industrious
and careful application of these signs, but also of a
tolerably long use. The oldest hieroglyphics of the
date of the great pyramids are for the most part
embossed; but even the engraved work of a date
very little more recent is not surpassed by later times
in artistic excellence, in sharpness and neatness of
execution.</p>

<p>The study of the calendar of Egypt, no less than
the use of writing upon the great monuments,
carries us back to an early date for the beginning of
Egyptian civilization. We saw that the priests, by
adding five days to the old year of 360 days, had come
tolerably near to the natural year, and had fixed
the beginning of their year by the rising of Sirius.
Monuments of the age of the Amenemha and
Sesurtesen show that even then the rising of Sirius
had been observed and noted. Nevertheless, the
beginning of their short civic year tended to anticipate
the natural year; and thus the Egyptian year
was always in advance of the solar. But if it was
observed and noted down by the Egyptians, that in
the year of their reckoning, corresponding to the
Julian year 1322 <small>B.C.</small>, the beginning of the year had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
again fallen on the right day, that is, on the rising of
Sirius, so that the first day of Thoth in the movable
year coincided with the first day of Thoth in the solar
year, which was the 20th of July, it follows that the
fixing of the beginning of the year on July 20, and of
the length of the year at 365 days, had taken place
1,460 years (<a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a>) before the date 1322 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the
year 2782 <small>B.C.</small> This conclusion is supported by another
consideration. Our astronomers have calculated that
it was only in the two or three centuries preceding
and following the year 3285 <small>B.C.</small> that the rising of
Sirius so exactly coincided with the summer solstice
and the rise of the Nile; and therefore in this epoch
only could the observation have been made that Sirius
brought the inundation. Hence in this period only
could the beginning of the year have been fixed at the
rising of Sirius. But if the Egyptians could set aside
an old calendar and introduce a new arrangement
requiring attention and long-continued observations,
somewhere about the year 2800 <small>B.C.</small>, it is clear that
the beginnings of higher culture in Egypt cannot be
later than 3000 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Valuable as this result is, we are nevertheless
carried back to hypotheses and combinations in order
to fix the various epochs, and more especially before
the reign of the Hyksos. And as an arrangement of
history is impossible without chronology, divisions
must be assumed here and there where it is impossible
to establish them satisfactorily. The arrangement of
Egyptian chronology proposed by Lepsius has for
the first time introduced a well-considered system
into the whole. Hence, in spite of the objections
already brought forward against the basis of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
arrangement, and the proved uncertainties and contradictions
of tradition and the monuments, which
the progress of inquiry into the older periods may
indeed lessen but cannot remove, I follow the data
given by Lepsius for the epochs of Egyptian history,
and the duration of the reigns which come under
our notice.</p>

Taking the total given by Syncellus from Manetho of 3,555 years before
Nektaneb&ouml;s, Lepsius arrives at the years 3,892 <small>B.C.</small> Bunsen also considers
the number 3,555 to be from Manetho, but without historical value. He
insists on this number because he allows Manetho to reckon 1,286 years
for the new monarchy, 922 years for the Hyksos, and 1,347 years for the
old monarchy; but for these 1,347 years he substitutes the 1,076 years of
Eratosthenes, in order to fix the historical accession of Menes. According
to this, Menes began to reign in the year 3284 <small>B.C.</small> From this, Reinisch
("Zeitschrift der Deutschen morgenl. Gesell." 15, 251 ff.) has attempted
to reconcile the systems of Bunsen and Lepsius. He retains the total of
3,555 years, and the year 3,892 <small>B.C.</small> for Menes; to the 1,076 years given

advances one day in every four years, while others which are celebrated in

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE RELIGION OF THE EGYPTIANS.</h3>


<p>Next to its language the oldest possession of a nation
is its religion. Living in a country of very distinct
outlines and characteristic forms, where the regularity
of external life is brought more prominently
before the view than in other countries, the Egyptians
at an early period arrived at a fixed expression of
their religious feelings and of the forms of their gods.
Their original conceptions are unknown to us. The
oldest monuments, our earliest sources of information,
present us with a numerous assemblage of gods, and the
conclusions drawn from these carry us back to views
far removed from primitive forms of worship. They
indicate a system already developed in the circle of
the priests. We can only attempt from the fragments
of that system preserved in inscriptions and manuscripts,
and the very late accounts of the Greeks, to
deduce conclusions concerning the religious notions
which originally predominated.</p>

<p>The distinction in the nature of the upper and
lower valley, already referred to, cannot have been
without influence upon the direction of civic life among
the Egyptians, and the formation of their religious
ideas. So far as we can tell, these developed independently
at the same time in the upper and lower
country. In both districts peculiar forms were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
retained at the most prominent centres of religious
worship, until after the union of the country they
became amalgamated in all essential points.</p>

<p>Memphis worshipped the god Ptah. The great
sanctuary of the god at that city was held to be as
ancient as the city itself. So far back as our knowledge
extends, the Pharaohs were occupied with the extension
and adornment of this temple. Among the Greeks
the god of Memphis was known as Heph&aelig;stus: they
tell us he was represented in the temple by a dwarf-like
image; and that similar images of the children
of Ptah stood in a part of the temple only entered by
the priests.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The name Heph&aelig;stus, and the further
statement of the Greeks, that this god was the father
of the Sun-god, prove that in Ptah the Egyptians
worshipped not only fire, but the spirit of warmth and
light generally; and that they must have regarded him
as the origin and source of light.</p>

<p>Manetho puts Ptah at the head of the dynasties of
the gods. He ruled for 9,000 years before the other
gods. Inscriptions name Ptah "the lord of truth,"
the "father of truth," the "ruler of the sky," "the
king of both worlds." As the god of the light which
shows everything in its true form, he is the spirit of
truth; as the spirit of the light in the sky, he is the
lord of heaven. The inscriptions also say that Ptah
"moves the egg of the sun and the moon;" he is
called "the weaver of the beginnings," the "god
who rolls his egg in the sky." Consequently, to the
Egyptians Ptah was the mover of the luminaries, a
formative, creative spirit, and as he is called in the
inscriptions "the father of the father of the gods," he
must have been to them the first and oldest god, the
beginning of the gods and of all things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptians believed that a kind of beetle
peculiar to their country (<i>scarab&aelig;us sacer</i>) was propagated
without the female sex; they saw the mode
of its reproduction in the balls of dung which the
beetles occasionally pushed before them. Hence they
consecrated this insect to their god of beginning and
creation, and on monuments and records we find the
god Ptah with a beetle on his shoulders, in the place
of a human head. As the god of the beginning he
appears on monuments in the shape of a child or
dwarf; and again, as the unchangeable god, he is
wrapped in the casings of a mummy, with the
symbols of dominion, the whip and sceptre, or the
so-called Nile-gauge, a ring with parallel cross bars,
in his hand, in order to denote him as the god who
gives to all things measure, order, and law. He is
also coloured green, to signify, as it would seem, that
lie is a god favourable to vegetation, and possessed of a
fertilising power.</p>

<p>Thus Ptah was one of the forms under which the
Egyptians invoked the creator, the highest god. On a
pillar of Memphis, now in the Berlin Museum, belonging
to the time of the nineteenth dynasty, he is called
"the only unbegotten begetter in the heaven and on the
earth," "the god who made himself to be god, who
exists by himself, the double being, the begetter of the
first beginning." Other inscriptions and records denote
him as "the creator in heaven and on earth, who has
made all things, the lord of all that is, and is not."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Below Memphis lay On, the city of the sun
(Heliopolis). Here the spirit of the sun, Ra, was the
pre-eminent god. In Manetho's list Ra succeeds Ptah
in the kingdom. "The Egyptians," says Plutarch,
"regard the sun as the body of the beneficent power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the visible form of a being only comprehensible to
thought. The morning sun they represented as a
new-born child seated on a lotus leaf, and thrice each
day&mdash;at sunrise, noon, and sunset&mdash;they offered
incense to Helius."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> We also find that the
Egyptians represented the sun of the winter months
as a little child, the sun of the vernal equinox as a
youth, that of the summer solstice as a bearded man,
and again, the sun of the autumnal equinox as an
old man.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Hence they looked at the yearly course
of the sun under the allegory of human life.
Plutarch's remark about the morning sun shows
that they regarded the daily course of the sun from
the same point of view, and when he tells us that
according to Egyptian story, Apopis made war against
the god of the sky,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> his statements are confirmed by
the monuments. According to the inscriptions Ra
is "revealed in the abyss of the sky," he is throned
"in the orb of the sun," "he moves his egg."
"A Supplication to Ra"&mdash;such are the words of a
prayer&mdash;"who each day by himself brings himself to
a new birth. Ra has created all that is in the abysses
of the sky."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the tombs of the Ramesids, at
Thebes, the course of the sun is represented by the
hour of the day and night. On the form of the blue
outstretched goddess of the sky appears the boat of
the sun, for the Egyptians conceived the sun as
navigating the air in a skiff, as they navigated the
Nile; and in the boat is Ra, a child with finger in
mouth at the first hour of the morning. As the day
goes on the child increases in size, and at every hour
the spirits who lead the boat are changed. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
hours of the afternoon the evil serpent, Apep, the
darkness, the Apopis of Plutarch, attempts to swallow
the sun, but twelve spirits draw the serpent by ropes
to the side. In the hours of the night the sun-god is
inclosed in his shrine on the boat, which is carried
along by spirits changing every hour over the waters
of the under world to the east&mdash;just as the boats on
the Nile are drawn against the stream&mdash;so that he
may again shine out in the east on the next morning.
The hieroglyphics accompanying the navigation of the
night hours contain seventy-four invocations of Ra
in Amenti, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in his concealment. In a similar
way the monuments of Edfu exhibit the growth of
the sun-god through the twelve hours of the day from
a child to a youth and a man, and an old man bowed
with age, leaning upon a staff. This last is called in
the inscriptions, "The old man who becomes again
a child."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The monuments exhibit Ra in red, with the sun's
orb on his head, a sceptre in one hand, and the symbol
of life in the other. The cat, the tawny bull, and the
hawk are the chosen creatures of Ra; often he is
found on the monuments with the head of a hawk in
the place of the human head, or as a hawk carrying the
sun's orb. All the entrances of the temple and the
pylons display the symbolical form of the deity, the
sun's orb, supported by two wings. From the sun-god
the kings of Egypt derived their might and power.
They generally call themselves "the sons of Ra," and
they rule over Egypt as Ra rules over the world.</p>

<p>Hence we can assume that to the minds of the
priests Ptah was essentially the deity of beginning,
the first originator of creation. Ra again was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
propagating and sustaining power of the divinity
embodied in the sun.</p>

<p>At Hermopolis (Ashmunein), besides Thoth, whom
the Greeks compared to their Hermes, and the inscriptions
name the "Lord of divine truth," the "scribe
of truth," to whom the white Ibis with black neck
and beak is sacred, the "children of Ptah" were
worshipped. These were eight gods in four pairs.
Owing to this worship Hermopolis was known to the
Egyptians as Pe-sesennu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the city of reverence."
These children of Ptah seem to have been spirits of
the elements. In an inscription at Edfu we find,
"The eight gods, the very great, who are from the
beginning, created before the gods, the children of
Ptah, arising through him, begotten of him, to take
possession of the south and the north, to create in
the Thebaid, and fashion in the land of Memphis.
When they arose the stream flowed out from the
young waters, the child of the lotus flower rose up in
the boat, the beautiful one, making this earth bright
by his beams."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>At Sais, at Buto, on the Sebennytic mouth, and at
Bubastis (Tel Basta), on the Pelusiac arm of the
Nile, female goddesses were worshipped. To the
feast of the goddess of Sais, whom the Greeks called
Athene, the Egyptians came from the whole country,
as Herodotus tells us, to Sais, and lighted lamps on
the appointed night, and even those who did not come
to Sais lit lamps, so that lamps were burning throughout
all Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Jamblichus and Proclus tell us that
the goddess of Sais, the Neith of the Egyptians, was
the mother of the sun-god; the inscriptions call Neith
"the cow which bore the sun," "ancient mother of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the sun," "mother of the gods." Hence we may
assume that Neith was associated with Ptah, whose
green colour she shares on the monuments; and that
the creative power of nature was personified in her
under a female form. The feast of lamps may have
symbolised the birth of light, and its rise from the
darkness.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The goddess of Buto, who was also worshipped
at Letopolis, near Memphis, was compared
by the Greeks with their goddess Leto, whose
child was Apollo, the spirit of light, because at
Buto the victorious god of light of the Egyptians,
of whom we shall speak below, was said to have
grown up.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The sanctuary of the goddess at Bubastis was,
according to Herodotus' account, the most delightful,
though not the largest or most costly, in the whole of
Egypt. It was situated in the middle of the city,
and could be seen from every side. "Beyond the
market-place a paved road, about forty feet in width,
leads to the shrine, which is overshadowed by trees
on both sides. The precincts, a place of about a stadium
square, is surrounded with a trench one hundred
feet broad; this is connected with the Nile, and also
planted with trees. The portico is ten fathoms high,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and adorned with statues six cubits in height, and well
worth description. On the external walls pictures are
everywhere engraved, and the temple in which the
statue of the goddess stands is also surrounded by
very lofty trees. At the festival of the goddess the
Egyptians from all the land go down in boats to
Bubastis: in every boat is a number of men and
women; some of the men blow the flute; some of
the women have castanets, and strike them; the rest
sing and clap their hands. The boat touches at every
city on the river bank; and here also the women sing
and strike their castanets, while others follow the
women of the city with shouts and raillery; others,
again, dance; others expose themselves. On arriving
at Bubastis, they bring large offerings to the goddess,
and drink more wine at this festival than in
all the rest of the year. According to the accounts
of the Egyptians, about 700,000 men and women are
collected at this festival, without counting children.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus calls the goddess of Bubastis Artemis:
her Egyptian name was Bast and Pacht; and the
city was called after her Pa-Bast, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "abode of
Bast." On monuments this goddess has the sun's disk
upon her head, or, in the place of a human head, the
head of a cat, which animal was sacred to her. At
Heliopolis there was a picture of Ra in the form of a
he-cat;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and in the inscription Pacht is called the
daughter of Ra. Ra was invoked to come to the
help of his daughter, the holy she-cat, who was panic-stricken
by the snake which approached heaven in
order to tread upon the path of the sun-god, and to
defile the limbs of the holy she-cat.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In the sketches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in the "Book of the Dead" we find a she-cat, with the
right forefoot upon the head of a serpent, and in the
left a broad knife, with which she is cutting off the
head of the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The account given by Herodotus
of the customs observed at the festival are confirmed
from other sources. The monuments exhibit musicians,
whose music is accompanied by the audience
with clapping of the hands; and Plutarch describes
the castanets of the Egyptians adorned with the
figure of a human-headed she-cat, the sound of
which was intended to scare away the evil spirit.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In the upper country other deities were worshipped.
At Thebes, Amun, known to the Greeks
as Ammon, took the place occupied by Ptah at
Memphis. Hecat&aelig;us of Abdera relates that the
Egyptians identified their supreme god with the
universe, but the god was invisible and concealed.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Amun, as a fact, signifies "the concealed" or "veiled."
The monuments of Thebes exhibit him as a creative
god with the Phallus, as a ruling deity either standing
or sitting on a throne; on his royal head-dress are two
upright feathers, which to the Egyptians were the
symbol of dominion over the upper and under world,
and in his hand are the sceptre and the symbol of
life. His colour is blue. By his side stands the
goddess Mut; the "mother," the "lady of darkness,"
as the inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> style her. She wears on her
head the vulture, or the crown of Upper Egypt. She
is also found on inscriptions with the head of a vulture,
the bird sacred to her, instead of a human head;
and in pictures of battles the vulture of Mut hovers
over the Pharaoh as the symbol of protection. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
son of Ammon and Mut is Shu (Sosis, Sos), the spirit
of the atmosphere, "the bearer of heaven," as the
inscriptions name him.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This (Thinis) and Abydus
were the chief seats of his worship. In Manetho's list
the reign of Shu follows on those of Ptah and Ra.</p>

<p>In the place of Ammon we often find another
divinity, Tum (Atmu.) This was the sun-god in a
special form. In Upper Egypt the spirit of the sun
was invoked under the names Tum and Mentu. Of
these names the first signified the declining sun, the
sun of the west, the sun of concealment, the sun
in the under world; the second the rising sun, the
sun of the east, the sun of the day, the bright sun-god.
Tum also wears the double crown, and the two
feathers of Ammon, or in the place of them the two
royal serpents round his head-dress; he also is lord of
both kingdoms. Like Ptah, he is "the father of
beginnings, who begot himself," "the father of the
gods;" like him also he is formed with the beetle in
the place of the human head; as the creative god he is
the creator of his name, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of his properties; he is
the prim&aelig;val night, the darkness of the beginning,
before light existed. To him also belonged the
prim&aelig;val water. According to Plutarch, the Egyptians
believed that the sun arose out of moisture, that it
sprang up out of water, and was nourished by it, and
therefore water was the beginning and origin of
things. This account is confirmed by the monuments.
As light in the process of production, Tum is called
"Ra in his egg;" and as the spirit of light arising
out of darkness and water, the horologe and the
sun-dial are his insignia.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>At Coptus, in Upper Egypt, a phallic god was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
worshipped under the name Chem, whom the Greeks
compared to their god Pan, and at the falls of
Syene a ram-headed god, Chnum (Chnemu, Chnuphis,
Kneph), who in inscriptions is named the lord of
the "inundations," of the "outpouring of the waters."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
As a giver of fruits, the colour of his pictures on the
monuments is generally green. In the eyes of the
inhabitants of Upper Egypt Chnum was, according to
the account of Plutarch, an uncreated eternal spirit.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
We must therefore regard him as a peculiar form of
the life-giving god. Chnum was often united with
Ammon, inasmuch as the latter assumes the attributes
of Chnum, the ram's horns or even head.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> As
the worship of Ammon passed beyond Egypt up
the Nile as far as Meroe, so the worship of Ammon-Chnum
spread westward in the Libyan desert as
far as the oasis of Siwa, where the inhabitants were
called by the Greeks Ammonians. Here, even now,
in the vicinity of a clear pool surrounded by lofty
palms, the remains of a considerable temple are to
be seen, with hieroglyphic inscriptions, and the
picture of the ram-headed deity.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The worship of the goddess Hathor was widely
diffused both in Upper and Lower Egypt. The most
renowned seats of the cultus were Aphroditopolis,
near Memphis; Edfu and Dendera, in Upper Egypt.
She is called in the inscriptions "the lady of the
dance and revel," and is represented on the monuments
with fetters and a tambourine in her hands. From
this and from her Grecian name we may conclude
that she was the Egyptian goddess of love, of the
enchaining passion; but though we find in her form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
hints of a more individual and lively fancy, the natural
power of maternity in general is by far the most
prominent conception. She is represented with the
horns of a cow&mdash;her sacred animal&mdash;on her head,
and between them the moon's disk; or entirely
as a cow. In the rock-temple at Abusimbel, which
the wife of Ramses II. dedicated to Hathor, she is
represented as a cow in a boat, over which water-plants
meet in arches. To this cow the king and
queen offer flowers and fruits.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In the temple at
Edfu, a structure of the Ptolemies, 360 local forms of
Hathor are said to have been enumerated and among
these seven were especially prominent.</p>

<p>It was the beneficent, creative, and life-giving powers
of nature which the Egyptians worshipped in these
divinities&mdash;water, light, the clear heaven, the sun,
the powers of reproduction and birth. But the
phenomena and the powers presented by nature were
not in every case beneficent. Night swallowed up
day, and death swallowed up life. Beside the waters
and the black fruitful soil of Egypt lay the boundless
yellow desert, from which storms blew the sand into
the green valley. In the hot months, the sun blazed
with a devouring and scorching heat, the flowers
withered; and the powers of nature failed in the
winter. Thus in the life of nature there was a strife
between malignant and beneficent powers, a strife in
which nevertheless the beneficent powers always gained
the upper hand. Out of night arose a new day; out
of the death of nature in winter blossomed forth new
increase, fruitfulness, and life. Through this conception
of a strife raging between the healing and
destructive powers of nature, by regarding nature as
moving in a circular course from life to death, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
death to life, the Egyptians succeeded in making a
great advance in their religious ideas. They personified
this strife in certain divine forms. The beneficent
power, the divinity of life was allowed to succumb,
and then to rise from apparent death into a new life.
Only for a moment could the evil powers vanquish
the good; the eternal victory remained with the gods
of beneficence.</p>

<p>After Helius, Heph&aelig;stus, Ammon, and Hermes,
says Diodorus,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Cronos and his sister Rhea ruled.
These became the parents of Isis and Osiris, of
Typhon, Apollo, and Aphrodite. Plutarch tells us
that, according to the legend of the Egyptians, Rhea
and Cronos were the parents of Osiris and Isis, of
Typhon and Nephthys. Osiris ruled happily over
Egypt; but Typhon conspired against him with
seventy-two associates; they inclosed Osiris in a chest
and threw it into the Nile, and the stream carried
it down to the sea. When Isis heard of it, she put
on mourning, and sought with lamentation the body
of Osiris. At last she found the chest in the neighbourhood
of Byblus, where the sea had cast it up;
she mourned over the corpse and carried it back to
Egypt. And when Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris,
who grew up in Buto, came to his full strength, he
prepared to avenge the wrong which Typhon had
done to his father and mother. Thrice he fought
with Typhon; the battle raged for many days, and
Horus conquered.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>According to the accounts of Herodotus and Diodorus,
Osiris (Dionysus) and Horus (the Apollo of the
Greeks) were the last rulers of the divine race.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In
the list of Manetho, Ptah was followed in the kingdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
by Ra and Shu (or, according to the Theban account,
by Ammon, Tum, and Shu), Cronos, Osiris, Typhon,
and Horus. These then are the younger gods; the
evidence of the monuments shows that they were
connected by race with each other, but not akin to
the three gods who ruled before them. And as we
also find that the five supplementary days added in
the Egyptian year to the original number of 360
(<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>) were dedicated to these gods, the first to
Osiris, the second to Horus, the third to Typhon, the
fourth to Isis, the fifth to Nephthys&mdash;the natural
conclusion is that these gods were of later origin.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
On the other hand it is clear that the belief in Osiris
and his power had already arisen at the time when
the great pyramids were erected.</p>

<p>The two gods at the head of this circle, whom
Diodorus and Plutarch call Cronos and Rhea, were
known to the Egyptians under the names Seb and
Nut.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> They are the spirits of the earth and sky.
Osiris himself in the inscriptions and records is called
"the king of the gods," "the lord of unnumbered
days," "the king of life," "the regulator of eternity."
The inscription on the lid of a coffin runs thus&mdash;"Ra
gave thee the richly streaming light which gleams
in thy eyes. Shu gave thee the pleasant air which
in thy lifetime was inhaled in thy nostrils. Seb gave
thee all fruits whereon thou livest. Osiris gave thee
the Nile-water whereon thou livest."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As a life-giving
god, the colour of Osiris is green; his sacred
tree is the evergreen tamarisk; and his sacred bird
a kind of heron, distinguished by two long feathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
at the back of the head. Osiris is always represented
in a human form, and with a human head.</p>

<p>The chief seats of the worship of Osiris were Phil&aelig;
and Abydus, in Upper Egypt. In the temple on the
island of Phil&aelig;, formed by the Nile above Syene, the
history of the god was represented.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>  On a little
island close by, where only the priests might tread,
lay the grave of Osiris, overshadowed by tamarisks;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
here were libations offered to him, and Diodorus
tells us that in Upper Egypt no more sacred form
of oath was known than the oath by Osiris who rests
at Phil&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In the temple of Osiris at Abydus
(Arabat-el-Medfuneh) the wealthy Egyptians sought
to be buried, that they might rest in the vicinity of
the god's grave. In Lower Egypt Osiris<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> was worshipped
in the cities of Memphis, Sais,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and Busiris.
At Busiris (the name Pe-osiri meant "abode of Osiris"),
on the Sebennytic arm of the Nile, in the middle of
the Delta&mdash;it was the chief city of the district of
Busiris&mdash;was situated the largest temple of Isis, as
we learn from Herodotus, and here also, according to
other evidence, the grave of Osiris was to be found.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Here the whole land worshipped this god and goddess.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Thousands of men and women assembled, according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Herodotus, made lamentation for Osiris, and brought
an offering to the greatest goddess (Isis). Amid
prayers the bull was flayed, the thighs and other parts
cut out, and a part of the belly filled with bread,
honey, and incense; these were drenched plentifully
with oil, and set on fire, and so long as the sacrifice
burned the people lamented. When the lamentation
ended, the remainder of the sacrifice was eaten.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Plutarch says that with Osiris the Egyptians lamented
the receding of the Nile, the ceasing of the cool north
wind, the death of vegetation, and decrease in the
length of the day. On the 17th Athyr, the day on
which Typhon slew Osiris (on this day the sun passes
through the Scorpion), the priests instituted rites of
lamentation, and, among other things, as a sign of
the sorrow of Isis, they exhibited for four days a
gilded cow, covered with a black veil of byssus&mdash;for
the cow was the Egyptian symbol of this goddess.
On the 19th Athyr, in the night, they went down
to the sea, and the priests brought out the chest, and
the congregation cried, "Osiris is found!"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Moreover,
according to Plutarch, the holy rites represented the
burial of Osiris: in these the wood was cut for the
chest, the linen torn for cerements, and libations
poured. A serpent was also slain in effigy.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> About
the time of the winter solstice, as Plutarch tells us in
another place, the Egyptians carried "the cow," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
Isis, seven times round the temple, and this procession
was called the search for Osiris.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> On the monuments
the Isis worshipped with Osiris appears generally in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
youthful shape, with the horns of a cow on her head,
the moon's disk between the horns, with the flower-sceptre
and symbol of life in her hands. The
inscriptions denote her as the "royal consort," the
"great goddess." An image in which she was represented
in the form of a cow was seen by Herodotus
in the royal palace of the last Pharaohs at Sais. "In a
beautifully-adorned chamber lay the wooden image of
a cow, resting on her knees, not larger than a full-grown
cow. The body was covered with a purple
robe; on the neck and head could be seen the thick
gilding, and between the horns a golden disk. Every
day incense was burned before the image; and at
night a lamp was kindled before it. Once a year,"
continues Herodotus, "this cow was carried out into
the open, when the Egyptians lamented the god, whose
name I do not think proper to mention now."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Osiris and Isis, the spirits of blessing and life,
were attacked by Typhon. Plutarch observes that
the Egyptians called Typhon Set,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and this statement
is confirmed by the inscriptions. The colour of
Set was burning red,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> like the glowing sun in the dust
of the desert; the ass was the sacred animal of this
god, and a peculiarly-formed animal his symbol on the
monuments. In poisonous serpents also the Egyptians
saw this destructive deity, and they brought the crocodile
and hippopotamus into association with him. The
third of the five additional days of the year (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>),
which belonged to Set, was to the Egyptians an unlucky
day.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> On a papyrus he is called "the almighty
destroyer and blighter,"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and with this agrees the
statement of Plutarch, that Typhon, according to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Egyptians, had filled the whole earth and sea&mdash;which
they call "the foam of Typhon"&mdash;with evils; and
they considered all animals, trees, and vegetables, all
incidents of a harmful and destructive nature to be
works, parts and actions of Typhon.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The evil god can limit and overcome the beneficent
power of nature, but not for ever. Osiris had left
behind a young son, who could hold Typhon in check,
though unable to suppress him entirely. Horus, as
Plutarch tells us, was born about the time of the
winter solstice, and the festival of the delivery of Isis
was celebrated at the time of the vernal equinox.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
On the monuments we find Horus (Har), "the avenger
of his father Osiris," as the inscriptions call him,
represented as a naked child, with finger on lip, sitting
on a lotus-leaf, or on a crook, the symbol of dominion.
Hence he is the young Horus, the Harpocrates of the
Greeks, the Harpechruti&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, "Har, the child"&mdash;of
the Egyptians. Then, according to the legend, he
grows up at Buto; he becomes a handsome youth, the
strong Horus (Har-ver, Arveris of the Greeks), the
"great helper," the "pillar of the world." In the
temple at Phil&aelig; we see him pouring libations before
the bier of Osiris; on other monuments he guides the
sun's bark through the hours of the day.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> At Hermopolis,
as Plutarch tells us, a hippopotamus was to be
seen, on which a hawk&mdash;the sacred bird of Horus, in
which form the god is often represented&mdash;fought with a
serpent; and, according to the belief of the Egyptians,
Typhon escaped from Horus in the shape of a
crocodile.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The monuments represent Horus on the
sun-boat in the act of stabbing a serpent with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
human head,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Apopis, the serpent Apep; or
standing on crocodiles with serpents in his hands; or
as a winged sun's disk contending with a hippopotamus.
In an invocation of Horus, belonging to the
fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, we find the following: "Come to
me quickly on this day to guide the holy bark (the
sun's-boat), to force back all lions to the land of Egypt,
and all crocodiles into the Nile. Shamelessness and
sin (?) come and appear upon earth; but when Horus
is invoked he destroys them. All mankind rejoice
when they see the sun. They praise the son of Osiris,
and the serpent turns back."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Hence to the Egyptians
Horus was the triumphant god of light (Har-phre,
Horus-sun), who subdues gloom, and winter, and
drought. As a victorious god arousing fresh life, he
gives to the kings of Egypt life and victory. The
Greeks called the Egyptian Ra Helius, and Horus
Apollo; and these names correspond to the Egyptian
conception of these deities. The chief seats of the
worship of Horus were the two cities which the Greeks
called the great and little cities of Apollo (Edfu and
Kus) and Ombus. At Edfu Hathor was worshipped
beside Horus (<a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a>).</p>

<p>Plutarch tells us that Isis, in the minds of the
Egyptians, was the female receptive part of nature.
Osiris was the light, Typhon the darkness, the obscuration
of the sun and the moon; Osiris was the fruit-giving
Nile-water, Typhon the salt and barren sea;
Osiris was moisture, Typhon drought, the parching
wind, which overcomes and consumes moisture; Osiris
was health, Typhon disease; Osiris was the orderly,
unchanging; Typhon the passionate, irrational, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
giant-like; disturbances, blight, and tempest.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> It is
incorrect, Plutarch observes, in conclusion, to call
water, the sun, or the earth and sky Osiris and Isis;
and not less so to call the glowing sun and hot wind
Typhon. If we merely ascribe to Typhon all that
is immoderate or irregular in these, whether in the
way of excess or defect, and hold in reverence and
honour all that is orderly and good and useful as the
work of Isis, as the image, likeness, and essence of
Osiris, we shall hardly go wrong.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Thus there can be little doubt about the meaning of
the myth. When the Nile receded and the sirocco
from the south drove back the refreshing north wind,
when the hot days&mdash;for these are the seventy-two
fellow-conspirators of Typhon&mdash;parched up the soil;
then had Typhon struck down Osiris. Then, as
Plutarch says, "the Egyptians bewailed the decay of
the fruits, and prayed the gods to send new in the
place of those that were gone, and allow them to
spring forth again." When the seed was cast into the
ground, the Egyptians buried Osiris: but the sacred
rites were an imitation of the sufferings of Isis, and
the incidents which occurred when the body was
deposited in the tomb. The progressive decay of
productive power towards the north during the
hot days, and the winter, which was indicated in
the myth by the carrying of the corpse of Osiris to
the sea, and the custom of carrying the chest to the
coast (<a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>), is part of the Egyptian conception;
that Isis discovers the body at Byblus on the
Phenician coast is probably an invention of the Greeks,
who confounded the Phenician horned goddess Astarte,
Ashtaroth Karnaim, with Isis. When Egypt was again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
fertilised by the inundation, when the days began to
lengthen after the winter solstice, when the sun shone
with fresh brightness, and the new fruit budded forth,
then Horus, the child born about the winter solstice,
waxed strong at Buto in the north of Egypt&mdash;then
he overcame Typhon. The renewed power of the
sun, the returning life of nature, the fresh blessings of
the new year&mdash;these are the avenging son of Osiris.</p>

<p>When the creative and receptive powers of nature
had thus been comprehended in the forms of Osiris
and Isis, the divinities in whom creative power and
receptivity had hitherto been perceived naturally
coalesced with these forms to a greater or less degree.
Thus Ptah of Memphis, Tum of Thebes, the sun-god
of Heliopolis, are combined with Osiris (the title
Ptah-Osiris is not uncommon in the inscriptions,)
though they are also retained as separate deities.
Thus also Isis is identified with Neith of Sais, with
Mut of Thebes, with Hathor, with Bast,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the goddess
of Bubastis. Horus, again, is identified with Chem
and Ra, though at the same time his personality as
the youthful, vigorous spirit of light is strongly
marked. Plutarch is certainly right in his remark
that the Egyptians regard Osiris as the personification
of everything in heaven and the under world.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> All
the other deities were transfigurations and manifestations
of Osiris, mere modifications of his nature.
When Osiris is called the soul of Ra,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> this can hardly
have any other meaning but this, that the appearance
of the sun-god in the visible world is an incarnation
of the invisible nature of Osiris.</p>

<p>The Egyptians often represented their deities with
the heads, or in the shape of, the animals sacred to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
them; that is, they recognised the nature of the
deities who were primarily conceived under the
form of men, in the races of the beasts which
they allotted to them. To the Egyptians these animals
must have appeared so closely and intimately
connected with the deity to which they belonged,
that the nature of the deity was better expressed and
made more visible in the shape of the beast than in
the shape of man. We must assume that the predominance
of a distinct mark or characteristic property
in the races of animals, that their simple, uniformly
instinctive life created this conception in the mind of
the Egyptians, to whom a fixed and unalterable course
of action, an unchanging and typical nature, was the
ideal. The force of nature, the regular recurrence
of certain phenomena, coalesced in the Egyptian mind
with the blind, unchanging action of animals. Yet
animals were also seen to possess freedom and movement,
and an individual existence. This combination
of the type and the individual must have seemed to
the Egyptians to correspond to the nature of their
deities. The mystery of life, the natural law, which
lay at the base of their worship, must for them have
reached its most distinct and lively realisation in
these animals.</p>

<p>The bull is the sacred animal of the creative gods:
the cow of the goddesses of birth and receptivity;
the ram is sacred to Chnum; the hawk and the cat
to the deities of light and the sun; the beetle to
Ptah; a kind of heron to Osiris; the vulture to Ptah
and Isis; a kind of ibis to Thoth; the dog-ape to
Anubis, the "ruler in the west;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>" the crocodile to the
god Sebek, who was worshipped at Arsinoe, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Herodotus tells us that when a cat died in a house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
all the inhabitants shaved their eyebrows; and that at
conflagrations the Egyptians directed all their attention
to saving the cats, not to quenching the flames,
and if, in spite of their efforts, a cat leapt into the
flames and was burnt, the Egyptians made a great
lamentation.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> "To each of the races of the sacred
animals," says Diodorus, "a certain piece of land is
consecrated, the products of which suffice for the food
and tending of the race. Those entrusted with the care
of each race have to feed them. To feed the hawks
they cut up pieces of flesh, and call loudly to the
birds till they come and take their food. The cats
they coax by giving them bread and milk, or chopped
fish from the Nile, and thus provide them with suitable
food. These duties they do not scruple to perform
before the whole people; on the contrary, they are
proud of them as of the highest offices which they
can attain to in the service of the gods. With special
symbols to distinguish them, they proceed through
town and country, and as it is known from the
symbols what animal it is whose servants are approaching,
all who meet them bow the knee and pay
homage. If one of the animals dies, it is wrapped
in a costly covering, and, amid loud lamentations
and beating of the breast, it is carried away to embalment.
Steeped in oil of cedar, or any other kind
remarkable for its scent and powers of preservation,
the corpse is then buried in the holy sepulchres. Anyone
who intentionally kills a sacred animal is punished
with death; and everyone who has caused the death
of an ibis or a cat, intentionally or unintentionally,
must die, and is often killed in the most cruel manner,
without any sentence passed upon him, by the collected
mob. So deeply rooted is the reverence for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
sacred animals in the feeling of the people, so persistently
does everyone cling to the worship of them, that
even at the time when Ptolemy was not yet declared
an ally by the Romans, and the nation was most
anxious to pay respect to visitors from Italy, and to
give no cause for war, when a Roman had unintentionally
killed a cat, the mob gathered at his house,
and neither the officers sent by the king to quiet
them, nor the prevailing awe of the Romans, could
protect him from their vengeance. This fact I have
not received from hearsay: I was in Egypt and
saw the occurrence. But what is done for the
animals which are kept in the temples is easy to
narrate, but difficult for anyone to believe who has
not seen it."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Among the races of animals which, according to
Egyptian belief, shared in the nature of the deities to
which they were sacred, were certain pre-eminent
specimens. These were recognised by certain signs
by the priests, and passed for a special incarnation of
the deity. They were brought into his temple, and
there worshipped and prayed to as his manifestation.
The most sacred among these selected animals was
Apis, the bull, in the temple of Ptah, at Memphis.
According to the account of Herodotus, the Egyptians
believed that a ray of light from heaven had impregnated
the cow, which brought forth an Apis: by
Plutarch, the impregnation is said to take place by a
ray of the moon.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The priests recognized Apis in a
black bull, which had a triangular white spot on the
forehead, a fleshy growth under the tongue in the
form of the sacred beetle of Ptah, white spots on his
back in the shape of an eagle, and bi-coloured hairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
in the tail.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> When an Apis was found, he was, says
Diodorus, in the first place brought for forty successive
days to the meadow of the "city of the Nile" (Nilopolis),
where women were shown to him, who were afterwards
excluded from the sight of the Apis. Then
he was conveyed on a boat in a golden shrine like
a god to the temple of Ptah, at Memphis. There he
was bathed in the holy place, and anointed, and the
most precious frankincense was constantly burned
before him. He received the most beautiful garments,
the richest bedding-places, and the most handsome
cows as his "bed-fellows"; the most distinguished
men provided him with the best food at a very great
expense. When the Apis died of old age he was
honoured with a splendid funeral. "When, on the
death of Alexander, Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, made
himself master of Egypt, it happened that the Apis
died, and the person entrusted with his care not only
spent his own large fortune upon his burial, but borrowed,
in addition, fifty talents from Ptolemy. Even
in my own times certain feeders of the sacred animals
have spent not less than one hundred talents on a
single funeral."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>"The Egyptians," Diodorus remarks, "are of
opinion that the soul of the dead Osiris passed into
this bull, and thus continues among them, and will
so continue among their descendants." Plutarch says
that the Apis at Memphis was an image of the soul of
Osiris. According to the usual account of the priests,
Osiris and Apis were one; for they taught that the
Apis was to be regarded as a fair image of the soul of
Osiris. Strabo tells us, "The bull Apis, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
revered as a god, is the same as Osiris. The temple
in which the Apis was kept stands beside the temple of
Heph&aelig;stus (Ptah). There is also a temple of Serapis
in that city, before which we saw sphinxes, buried in
the sand, some to the middle, some to the neck."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Evidence from other sources, no less than the monuments,
confirms these accounts of Diodorus and
Plutarch. The monuments exhibit the Apis with
the sun's disk and the royal serpent between his
horns, and Greek papyri tell us that the keeper with
whom the Apis was placed was known as the "Herdman
of Osorapi," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Osiris-Apis (Osarhapi).<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> We
may assume that this Osorapi was the Serapis or
Sarapis of the Greeks, and the temple of Serapis
a temple of Osorapi. The sphinxes buried in sand
at Memphis have been discovered on the plateau on
which the inhabitants buried their dead to the west of
the ruins of this city. They are found here in two
rows as often before the entrance of temples between
Abusir and Sakkarah. It is by following this path
of sphinxes that the discoverers were recently enabled
to find the ruins of the temple of Serapis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
temple of the grave of Osiris-Apis, and the sepulchral
chambers of the Apis-bulls hewn in the rocks
around it. The oldest of the tombs hitherto opened
belongs, according to the inscriptions, to an Apis
buried in the time of Amenophis III. (1524-1488
<small>B.C.</small>). Above ground rises a massive structure,
truncated at the top, and decorated with reliefs.
This is the mortuary chapel. A sloping passage,
the entrance to which lies before this structure,
leads beneath the earth to a sepulchral chamber, where
stands a sarcophagus with the mummy of the Apis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
The relief on the structure above exhibits the king
bringing a drink-offering to the Apis. Beside the
picture of the bull we read, "The living Osiris, the lord
of the sky: he is Tum (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>): his feathers are upon
him: he gives life for evermore." On the sarcophagus
of an Apis buried in a similar tomb in the reign of
Horus (1455-1443 <small>B.C.</small>), we read:&mdash;"Apis-Osiris,
the great deity who dwells in Amenti, the ever-living
lord." King Ramses II. (1388-1322 <small>B.C.</small>), in the
second half of his reign, caused a broad gallery to be
excavated under the rock, on both sides of which
chambers of about twenty feet high were subsequently
cut out as occasion required; in these were placed the
remains of the dead Apis-bulls in sarcophagi of basalt
or granite. When the gallery of Ramses was no longer
sufficient, Psammetichus I. caused a gallery still
larger and more beautiful to be excavated, and provided
with handsome cells. After Darius had extended
this second gallery, the bodies of the bulls were buried
in the chambers of it down to the times of the latest
Ptolemies. As yet sixty-four tombs in all have been
discovered; but of these only four were uninjured.
All the rest had been already opened by the Arabs,
plundered, and in part destroyed. The inscriptions
on the tombs in the galleries give the same representation
of the Apis as the older sepulchres. He is "the
Osiris again restored to life," the "revived Apis of Ptah,"
"the living Apis, which is Osiris abiding in Amenti,"
the "second Ptah." On a sarcophagus we read:&mdash;"Here
is Osiris Apis, who dwells in Amenti, the great
God, the eternal Lord, the ruler for all time." Another
inscription remarks "that he had been sought for
three months in the valleys of Upper Egypt, and on
the islands of Lower Egypt. When found he had been
brought to his throne in the temple, to his father Ptah,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in such and such a year, on such and such a day. The
happy duration of his life had been six-and-twenty
years; then the deity had been carried to burial,
as he had established himself in the good Amenti in
order to unite himself on his eternal throne with the
house of centuries." Or, as it is said in another
inscription, "the holiness of Apis has been brought
to unite himself with the good Amenti."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>By this constantly renewed incarnation in the form
of a bull, the emblem of generation, the god of life
gave the Egyptians a guarantee for the continuance
of his grace, and the perpetuation of their life in this
world and the next. Whether other forms of incarnation
beside this were ascribed to the god cannot be
determined.</p>

<p>At the time when the Nile began to rise, or shortly
before it, there appeared in Egypt from year to year
a peculiar kind of heron, distinguished by two long
feathers on the back of the head.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This was known
to the Egyptians as Bennu. This bird, which announced
or caused the fertilisation or new life of
the land, could not but belong to the god of life. The
whole race, or a select specimen, appears in special
connection with Osiris, and the temple at Heliopolis.
In the oldest portions of the Book of the Dead, which
belong to the time of the Amenemha and Sesurtesen,
we find, "I am that great Bennu of On" (Heliopolis);
and the commentary adds, "Bennu is Osiris, viz., the
Osiris in On."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The inscriptions say of the great
Bennu that "it was self-begotten," that "it caused
the divisions of time to arise."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> This production of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
himself signifies the creative power of Osiris, and
the origin of the seasons might well be attributed to
the bird which regularly appeared announcing the
return of the period of fertilization. With the
cultus of the Bennu at Heliopolis is connected the
story of the ph&#339;nix. Herodotus tells us that he
was informed by the inhabitants of Heliopolis that
a bird, which, if it resembled the pictures, was gold-coloured
and red, and like an eagle in shape and
size, came from Arabia to their city once in every
500 years, and buried the corpse of his father in
myrrh in the sanctuary of the sun-god.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> From
later accounts we learn that the ph&#339;nix, on reaching
the age of 500 years, prepared a funeral pile
of spices, and burned himself upon it; then he recreated
himself, and carried the remains of his old
body to Heliopolis.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Tacitus says: "In the consulship
of Paulus Fabius and Lucius Vitellius (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in
the year 34 <small>A.D.</small>) after a lapse of centuries, the ph&#339;nix
appeared in Egypt. This bird, which was sacred to
the sun, returned after an interval of 500 years,
according to the most common accounts; according
to others after an interval of 1461 years. The first
ph&#339;nix appeared in the reign of Sesostris; the second
under Amasis; the third in the time of the third
Ptolemy; and as there was only a lapse of 250 years
between this Ptolemy and the reign of Tiberius, some
regarded the last ph&#339;nix as a spurious one."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> &AElig;lian
remarks: "The Egyptians are not agreed when the
500 years are completed; and the priests were at
variance whether the bird would appear then or later,
and when he ought to come; but amid their dissen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>sions
the bird suddenly appeared at the right time."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Pliny informs us that the cycle of the great year was
connected with the life of this bird, and with his
return the stars came again into their old position.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Horapollo maintains that the ph&#339;nix was a symbol of
the sun, and signified one who returned after a long
time from a far country.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> There is no doubt, therefore,
that the alleged appearance of the ph&#339;nix
signified to the Egyptians the close of an astronomical
period. On the monuments the planet Venus
is described as the "star of Bennu-Osiris." As the
morning star announced the day, the light returning
out of darkness, it could easily be appropriated to
Osiris, and that period might be connected with the
cycles of the planet Venus.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The selected cats of the sun-god and his daughter,
the goddess of Bubastis, the hawk of Horus, the ibis
of Thoth, the vulture of Mut, were regarded by the
Egyptians with no less veneration than the bulls of
Osiris. In a hymn to a male cat, which was kept for
Ra at Heliopolis&mdash;the hymn is to be found on a
memorial pillar of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;we read:
"Thy head is the head of the sun-god; thy nose is
the nose of Thoth, the twice mighty lord of Hermopolis.
Thy ears are the ears of Osiris, who hears the
voice of all who call upon him; thy mouth is the
mouth of the god Tum, the lord of life, he has preserved
thee from every stain. Thy heart is the heart
of Ptah; he has purified thee from every stain of evil
in thy members: thy teeth are the teeth of the god
Chunsu (the moon-god). Thy thighs are the thighs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of the god Horus, the avenger of his father Osiris,
who has retaliated upon Set the mischief he purposed
against Osiris."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Selected crocodiles&mdash;and even the
crocodile was worshipped, at least in some regions, as
in the Thebais and around the lake of Moeris&mdash;were
to be found at Thebes and Arsinoe. "For both these
animals," says Herodotus "(and they are so tame that
they allow themselves to be touched), the priests put
ornaments of glass and gold in their ears, and bracelets
on their fore-feet, and give them the best of food both
of meal and from the sacrifices, and attend to them
with the utmost care. When they die they are
embalmed, and buried in the sacred tombs."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Strabo,
who travelled through Egypt more than four hundred
years later than Herodotus, narrates that a sacred crocodile
was kept in the lake of Moeris, which was tame to
the priests. He was fed with the bread, wine, and flesh
brought to him by visitors. "Our host," Strabo continues,
"a man of distinction at Arsinoe, who showed
us the sacred things of the city, took cakes, roast
meat, and a drink mixed with honey, and went with
us to the lake. On the shore lay the crocodile; the
priests went up to him, two of them opened his jaws;
and the third put in first the cakes, then the meat,
and last of all he gave him the drink. Then the
crocodile ran into the water and swam to the opposite
bank. Another stranger came with similar presents:
the priests took them, ran round the lake and offered
them to the crocodile, when they had found him, in the
same manner as before."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Clement of Alexandria
describes the glory of the Egyptian temples, and then
continues thus: "The innermost shrine is veiled with
a curtain of cloth of gold; when the priest removes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the veil you see a cat, a crocodile, or a serpent of the
land rolling on a purple coverlet."</p>

<p>According to the account of Herodotus, the dead
cats were embalmed in sacred tombs at Bubastis, the
hawks at Buto, the ibis at Hermopolis.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Mummies
of cats have been discovered at Thebes and
Sheikhassan; mummies of bulls, cows, jackals, dogs,
and vultures at Thebes and Sioot; of hawks and
ibises at Thebes, Hermopolis, Abydus, and Memphis;
of crocodiles at Thebes and Manfalut.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>This reverence for beasts, the excessive regard for
the nourishment of the sacred kinds and the preservation
of their bodies, the offering of prayers to them, the
worship of bulls, birds, and crocodiles as living gods,
the royal honours with which these selected examples
were buried, would of necessity be regarded as a
very rude superstition or degraded fetichism, hardly
compatible with the general level of civilisation and
culture in the country, had not the Egyptians united
a deeper feeling with their worship of animals. In
the living and yet typical forms of beasts as contrasted
with the deadness of nature, they saw not
only creations of the deities, but manifestations of the
divine life itself. The consecrated race of animals
participated in the nature of the god to whom it
belonged, and the specimens in the temples were an
unbroken series of incarnations of the deity.</p>

<p>In a different sense from the sacred animals, man
also was in the eyes of the Egyptians a manifestation
of the divine life and nature. If we set aside the
position of the kings (see below), we find no indication
that man was regarded as the incarnation of particular
deities or their attributes. Yet man had a
share in the immortality of the gods; and he who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
studied and desired the divine was thought by his
bodily death to arrive at a complete divine existence.
The primary result of this feeling was that the body
must be preserved as the vehicle of personality even
when life and soul have left it; it must be protected
from decay and ruin and any external disturbance by
nature or man. Beyond the reach of beasts of prey,
safe from the enemy and the destroyer, the corpses
must rest uncorrupted and uninjured in cool, secure,
inaccessible, unpolluted, indestructible graves. No
nation has devoted so much care and labour to the
preservation of the corpses, whether of men or of sacred
animals, as the Egyptians. It was almost the first
duty of the living to attend to the dead. And with
his body must be preserved all that the deceased
person had done or acquired in life: his occupation,
his actions must live on in the grave, like his corpse.
Pictures in his tomb must represent his life, and
inscriptions must give an account of it. "The Egyptians,"
says Diodorus, "speak of the dwellings of the
living as a lodging; but of the tombs of the dead as
eternal habitations, because the dead pass an endless
time in Hades. Hence they bestow less toil upon
their houses; but their tombs they furnish in a most
extraordinary manner."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The tombs are always turned towards the west, and
are deeply hollowed out in soil, or hewn in the rocks
of the Libyan mountains. Those of the wealthier
sort generally consist of two chambers, an upper and
a lower, or a front and a back one. The upper or
front chamber is furnished with a description of the
life of the dead person, his possessions, his office, his
occupation, and the most important results of his life
exhibited in relief and pictures.  It served as a chapel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in which the offerings to the dead were made. In the
lower or hinder chamber lay the corpse. The corpses
of the poorer inhabitants found their resting-place
in the common sepulchres. The preservation of the
corpse was accomplished in various ways. Either the
entrails were taken out through an aperture and
placed in separate vessels, or the corpse was protected
against corruption by the injection of various
substances; or finally it was allowed to lie for a
considerable time in saltpetre.</p>

<p>Like the embalmment and the tomb, the cerements
and the coffin were more or less costly, according to
the rank and wealth of the deceased. The dead person
was placed in a receptacle adapted to the shape of
the corpse, provided with a mask to represent his
face, and adorned with inscriptions and pictures. On
the breast was generally depicted the beetle of Ptah,
or an open eye, the symbol of Osiris. This receptacle
was then placed in two or more coffins, each inclosing
the other, which were made of more or less costly
wood. Rich persons added to their coffins the stone
sarcophagus, a hollow block of granite, the heavy lid
of which was then made so fast to the lower part that
it could not be opened without destroying the whole.</p>

<p>The sarcophagus was carried to the sepulchre in
solemn procession, led by the temple-servants, with
the necessary implements, and the bull destined for
sacrifice to the dead. Next were seen the implements
used by the deceased in his lifetime; the insignia of
his order, if he had been a priest, or in any office; or,
if he had held any military command, his chariot
followed. After this came the waiting-women, hired
for this purpose according to the custom of the East;
and men with palm-branches, the servants of the dead,
and the priests; last of all followed the sarcophagus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
on a boat&mdash;for the soul of the dead passed like
the sun-god on a boat to the under world. This
boat was on rollers, and drawn by oxen. The procession
was closed by the mourners of the family and
the friends. When the bull had been sacrificed
and frankincense burned to the gods, libations were
poured in honour of the dead. He was praised, as
Diodorus assures us, not because he was born of a
noble race, but because he had been carefully educated
and well instructed, because he had been pious towards
the gods, and had lived a just and sober life. Then
the kinsfolk implored the gods to receive the dead
into the society of the good. The accompanying
multitude joined in the prayer, and extolled the faith
of the deceased, who now would for ever pass his life
in the company of the good.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The coffin was then
brought into the upper chamber, and from thence,
when the ceremonies were completed, it was carried
to its proper resting-place, and placed on the west
side of it; the place was then closed and sealed.</p>

<p>According to the Egyptian story, Osiris was not
slain by Typhon. He did not die; he was only
taken away from men, as Diodorus says;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> he descended
into the under world; he passed away into
the invisible region, while in the visible world he continued
to live and work in the vigorous strength of
his son Horus. In the shape of Horus, or Ra, Osiris
wandered through the visible world. He changed
only his name and shape when, every evening, he
went back to his distant home in order to be alone.
Thus, by descending from earth and dying, he had
received the sovereignty of the lower world, and left
to the youthful Ra, his son Horus, the empire of this
world. As the sun goes down every evening, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
every morning awakes to new life, as the vegetation
dies away in the heat of summer and in autumn,
and again in the spring attains to new life, so to the
minds of the Egyptians death, in all its shapes, was
only death in appearance, in reality it was a transition
to a new life. And as Osiris remained alive in
death, and was the source of new life, so through
him and in him the soul of man was aroused out of
death to a new life. The sacred animals and men
were of divine nature and origin; they could not,
therefore, end with death; death could only carry
them back to their divine origin, to that other world,
from which they had come; and in that other world
they must awake to a new life.</p>

<p>Owing to this power of awakening life out of death,
Osiris became to the Egyptians the special god of the
human soul. As lord of the under world, Osiris
is often found on the monuments in the shape of a
mummy. His colour was in this case black, like his
bull in Memphis; his clothing was white;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> his symbol,
a wide-open eye, signifying the second beholding
of light. In this form of Osiris the Greeks recognised
the Dionysus of their Mysteries, whom they
could also compare with Osiris as the giver of fruits.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The Egyptians, says Herodotus, were the first to
maintain that the soul of man was immortal.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Plutarch, as we have already seen, informs us that to
the Egyptian Osiris was the embodiment not only
of all that is in heaven, but also of all that is in
the under world. "His soul," he continues, "was
regarded by the Egyptians as eternal and indestructible,
and, according to the doctrine of the priests,
Osiris ruled over the dead, as Hades and Pluto among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the Greeks. In reality, he was free and untouched
by everything subject to change and death. When
men are delivered from the body, and from pain, and
pass into the eternal and invisible world, where pain
is unknown, then Osiris becomes their king and
leader. They are his retainers, who desire him, and
are spectators of a beauty inconceivable and inexpressible
to men. This is the explanation of the story
most suitable to the deities."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The inscriptions on the sarcophagi, the wraps round
the corpses, but above all a papyrus roll placed in the
coffin with the dead body, the so-called "Book of
the Dead," enable us to ascertain with considerable
accuracy the views of the Egyptians on the fate of the
soul after death. The greater part of the known
manuscripts of this book belong to the seventh or
sixth century <small>B.C.</small> The contents show that rubrics
and prayers of the same purport, but differently drawn
up, proceeding from different times, and with different
commentaries, are collected together in order to provide
the dead person with everything he can want
in the next world. All the prayers and invocations
for that world are also given, in order that the most
effective may be at hand, just as at the end of these
manuscripts all the names under which Osiris can be
invoked&mdash;and they are more than a hundred&mdash;are
gathered together. But fragments of this Book of
the Dead, or, more strictly, this Book of the Resurrection,
which forms the core of the Egyptian doctrine
of the world to come, are found hewn in sarcophagi&mdash;already
with a triple commentary&mdash;which belong
to a date previous to the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>After death the soul of man descends with the
setting sun under the earth into the nether world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Here, on the day of the "valuation of words," the day
of "justification," the soul is examined, and its actions
weighed in the hall of double justice, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the justice
which rewards and the justice which punishes. Osiris,
with a crown upon his head, and holding in his hand
a crosier and a whip, sits upon a throne surrounded by
the water of life, out of which spring up lotus-flowers.
Beside him sit forty-two spirits; Anubis, the god with
a jackal's head, the leader and keeper of the dead,
and Horus, with a hawk's head, are busied with a
balance; in one scale is the heart of the deceased, in
the other an ostrich-feather, the symbol of truth and
justice. The god with the head of an ibis, the scribe
of truth, takes down the result of the weighing. As
Osiris, according to the legend, was once justified by
Horus and Thoth, so is every human soul justified by
those deities. The deceased assures them that he has
committed no sins; he enumerates forty-two errors
into which he has not fallen. He has done no wickedness;
he has not stolen, nor slain any one intentionally;
he has not allowed his devotions to be seen; he
has not been guilty of hypocrisy, or lying; he has not
stolen the property of the gods, or the sacrificial food;
he has not calumniated any one, or fallen into drunkenness
or adultery; he has not turned away his ear from
the words of truth; he has been no idle talker; he
has not slighted the king or his father; he has not
contemned the gods, or torn from the dead their linen
wraps.</p>

<p>The departed spirit was not allowed to enter the
other world in ignorance: he must know what awaits
him there; the path which he has to tread, and the
prayers which opened for him the gates of the various
regions, which gave him power to overcome whatever
spirits and monsters might meet him in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
way and attempt to hold him back; he must know
the charm which will at last unlock for him the fields
of Ra. He must know and recognise the gods to
whom he returns; the nature from which he has
sprung, and which he now again assumes. As in him
divinity has been made human, so is he now in turn
deified. To secure this knowledge for the dead, the
book is placed in his coffin, the important passages
were written on the wraps, and engraved on the coffin.</p>

<p>If the heart of the dead man was not found too light
and his soul was pure,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> he was acquitted in the other
world, he received back from the gods his heart and
members renewed and deified, and the goddesses of life
and the sky&mdash;Hathor and Nut&mdash;poured out upon him
the water of life. His prayer opened for him the gates
of the dwellings in the world to come; he was enabled
to strike with his lance the evil spirits and monsters,
the crocodiles, snakes, tortoises, the two vipers, and
the serpent Apep, to keep at a distance all impurity,
and finally to reach the fields of the sun-god.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Here
the blessed planted the heavenly wheat&mdash;of which the
ears were two cubits in length&mdash;wandered at will in
shady avenues with odours in their hair, and bathed
in pools of water.</p>

<p>Arrived among the gods, the soul receives the
power of assuming various existences&mdash;that is,
apparently, of entering into the bodies of men and
beasts, and returning finally into the divine substance
from which it sprang. Hence to the Egyptians death is
the "going up to heaven," the "entrance into heaven,"
the "entrance into the place of the gods."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
chapter of the Book of the Dead was to be pronounced
by the deceased on the day of his burial when going
forth from the grave at the western gate of the under-world,
in order to find immediate entrance there. "By
learning this chapter when on earth," so runs the close
of it in the book, "or by setting it forth in writing on
his tomb, he will emerge on the day, and on entering
into his dwelling he will not be thrust back. Food and
drink will be given to him, much flesh also on the table
of Ra; he will work in the fields on the plain of Aanro
(Paradise), where corn and wheat will be given to him;
he will live happily as he lived upon earth." On
the day of justification, the dead has to say: "I am
one of the initiated; thy name I know; I know the
names of thy forty-two gods, who dwell with thee
in the hall of twofold justice." Then comes the
answer: "Enter! thou knowest us."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> On a sarcophagus
of the time of the Amenemha and Sesurtesen the
deceased utters the following words, which are found
detailed at greater length and commented upon in the
seventeenth chapter of the Book of the Dead. "I
am Tum (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>), a being, which I alone am. I am
Ra in his first sovereignty. I am the great self-existing
god, the creator of his name, the ruler of all
gods, whom none of the gods restrains. I was
yesterday; I know the morrow. When I spoke a
battle-field was prepared for the gods. I know the
name of that great god who is there. Glory of
Ra is his name. I am the great Bennu which is
worshipped in On. I am Chem in his manifestation;
on me have been placed the two feathers on my head;
I have arrived at my land, I have arrived at my
dwelling-place."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> "The sun-mountain (horizon) of
his father Tum is meant,"&mdash;so run the commentaries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
both old and late, and at the same time they remark
that the great god, existing by his own power, is Osiris;
and the great Bennu also is Osiris (<a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>). By Chem is
meant Chemhor, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the Horus, who by his own power
renews his own youth every day. On the cover of the
sarcophagus we find the formula, "When this chapter
has been pronounced, he (the dead man) enters into
the western land at the time of his resurrection: if
entirely unacquainted with it, he cannot enter; for him,
as for one uninitiated, there is no resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Thus we must assume that the Egyptians believed
in man's return to his divine origin in the sense that
a soul which was not found wanting in weight,
and was conscious of its own true nature, was not
only received, after the completion of the proper cycle,
into the bosom of the godhead, and allowed to be
absorbed into the divine power, but was so far deified
that it could adopt divine attributes and power, and
even assume a divine title.</p>

<p>According to the account of Herodotus, the Egyptians
believed that the soul of the dead passed into
an animal, born at the time; from this it wandered
into all the other animals on earth, in the air and
the sea, and after 3,000 years it was again born
with a human body.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> That this account is incorrect
is proved by the records already quoted; it may
perhaps have arisen from the Egyptian conception that
the soul of the justified obtained the power to assume
every shape. But a purification of the unclean and
ignorant soul by passing through the bodies of all
kinds of animals could never have been assumed by
the Egyptians, since the sacred races were pre-eminent
manifestations, and the selected animals continuous
incarnations, of the gods. If a pilgrimage through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
bodies of beasts was really regarded by the Egyptians
as a course of punishment and amelioration, the beasts
meant can only be such as were not sacred. But as
yet the examination of the monuments and records has
by no means completely cleared up the relation of the
soul to the body it has left, nor has it attained to any
result on the fate in store for the souls which were
found wanting when weighed in the balance.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> The identification of Neith with Athene (Herod. 2, 62; Plat. "Tim."
p. 21) rests on the similarity of the name, on the torch-races in honour
of Pallas at Athens, and the feast of lamps at Sais. Gutschmid, "Beitr&auml;ge
zur Geschichte des alten Orients," s. 39, 45 ff., has shown that Neith
and Athene cannot be brought into agreement in points of language. The
inscription on the throne of Neith at Sais, given by Plutarch ("De Isid."
c. 9), "I am all that has been, is, will be, and no mortal has lifted my
robe," does not in the first part of it contradict certain applications of the
oldest text of the "Book of the Dead" (see below). On the other hand,
the second part is doubtful. In any case, the fact that the <i>peplos</i> has not
been raised does not refer to the inconceivable nature of the goddess, but
to seclusion from sexual intercourse. It can only mean that Neith was
born from her own creative force.</p></div>

assume that the chief town of the district of this name was the scene
of the festival. How the Greeks turned the name of this town into a
king Busiris who used to slay strangers, I cannot explain. Eratosthenes
in Strabo, p. 802, says: "There never was a king Busiris; the story
may have been invented owing to the inhospitality of the inhabitants of
Busiris;" and Diodorus observes: "It was not a king who was called
Busiris, but the grave of Osiris was so named in the native language"
(1, 88), which is near the truth.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE KINGDOM OF MEMPHIS.</h3>


<p>The lists of the Egyptians place Menes (Mena) at
the head of their series of kings. They describe him
as a native of This, a place in the neighbourhood of
Abydus, below Thebes, a district which Diodorus
considers the oldest part of Egypt. Menes passes
for the founder of the kingdom and the builder of
Memphis (Mennefer); he is said to have taught the
Egyptians the worship of the gods and the offering
of sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Herodotus informs us that he learnt
from the Egyptian priests that Menes had thrown a
dam across the Nile about 100 stades above Memphis,
and thus forced the stream which previously flowed
at the foot of the Libyan chain of hills to leave its
ancient channel, and flow at an equal distance between
the two ranges. When the land thus gained by the
dam had become firm, he built upon it the city, now
called Memphis, and still situated in the narrow part
of Egypt. Towards the north and west sides of the
city, Menes had excavated a lake, and filled it with
water from the river&mdash;which was itself a protection
to the city on the east,&mdash;and in the city he built the
greatest and most remarkable temple of Heph&aelig;stus
(Ptah).<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Diodorus observes:&mdash;The founder of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Memphis, the most splendid city in Egypt, selected
the most suitable site by founding the city in the place
where the Nile separates into several arms, so that the
city, lying on the pass, commanded the navigation up
the Nile. He also obtained for the place a wonderful
advantage and security by throwing a huge dam in
front of it towards the south, as the Nile at the time
of inundation overflows the district. This dam was a
protection against the rising water, and at the same
time served as an acropolis and defence from the
attack of enemies. On all the other sides of the city
he caused a large and deep lake to be excavated,
which received the overflow of the water and afforded
the strongest protection for the city. The circuit of
the city he placed at 150 stades, and owing to the
excellence of the situation, Memphis was generally
chosen by the kings as their place of residence.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The
situation, just a little above the place where the river-valley,
hitherto enclosed between the two ranges of
hills, opens out into the Delta, was certainly the best
adapted to form the centre of an empire extending
over the narrow valley of the upper river and the
broader district of the Delta, with its wealth of corn-land
and meadows, and to check the entrance of
enemies who came from the north-west or the north-east
into the upper valley, even when it was no longer
possible to maintain the Delta against them. About
fifteen miles above Memphis, at Kafr-el-Yat, the Nile
makes a considerable bend to the east, and modern
investigations claim to have discovered traces showing
that this curve is due to the hand of man.</p>

<p>Menes, whose accession, according to the arrangement
of Lepsius, would fall in the year 3892 <small>B.C.</small>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
was followed on the throne by King Athotis (Ateta),
who was said to have built the citadel at Memphis.
Next came Kenkenes, whose successor was Uenephes,
to whom is ascribed the erection of the pyramids.
We have seen what care and labour the Egyptians
devoted to their tombs, their "everlasting houses."
The west, where the sun sets, and the desert spreads
out in boundless expanse beyond the Libyan range,
belonged in their minds to the gods of night, of the
under-world, and of death. About ten miles to the west
of Memphis there rises a desolate and barren plateau
of rock, which for many miles runs parallel to the river,
about 100 feet above the blooming and animated valley
through which the Nile takes its course. In that
rocky soil, which separates the fruitful land from the
desert, the bodies of the dead were placed in chambers,
either hewn in the solid stone, or, where the soil was
less firm, built of masonry, and thus secured even
from the overflow of the river. Even the kings
sought their resting-places on this plateau of rock.
They, above all, gave attention to the solidity and
durability of their tombs; and in death, as in life,
they wished to be kings. The place where a king
rested must be marked as royal, and visible from a
distance; the grave of a king must tower over the
rest; his chamber must be of all most difficult to
open. Thus at first blocks of stone were rolled upon
the closed burial-place of a king, or a mound of earth
was raised over it, if sand and soil were to be obtained
in the neighbourhood. The strong winds which blew
from the desert made it, however, necessary to secure
these mounds, and cover them with stone. Hence by
degrees the sepulchral heaps acquired a definite shape:
they were rectangular structures, lessening toward the
apex; then, by extending the base and sharpening the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
gradient, they were brought into the form of pyramids,
and thus obtained the greatest possible firmness and
solidity. For a similar reason the core, or central
part, was no longer made of earth, but of brick;
where blocks of stone could be obtained they were
fitted into the core with more and more regularity,
until at last these structures were completed within
and without of rectangular hewn blocks of stone
in regular layers, and artificial mountains of stone
towered over the sepulchral chambers of the kings.</p>

<p>"At a distance of forty stades from Memphis,"
Strabo tells us, "is a range of hills, on which stand the
pyramids, or sepulchres of the kings. Among these,
three are especially deserving of notice. Rectangular
in shape, they are about one stadium high; and the
height is slightly less than the length of either side.
The sides are not equal, one is a little longer than the
other, and near the middle of the longer side is a
stone, which can be taken out. Behind this a winding,
hollow passage leads to the tomb. Two of these
pyramids stand close to each other on the same level;
at a distance, on a higher level, rises the third,
which, though much smaller, has been erected at
much greater cost." "Like mountains," says Tacitus,
"the pyramids have been raised amid impassable
quicksands by the emulation and power of the kings."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>About seventy of these structures, which rise in a
long line on the plateau of Memphis, from Abu
Roash to Dahshur,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> remain as witnesses of the rulers
of the old kingdom of Memphis and their dependants,
of the artistic skill and laborious industry of their
nation. Of some only the bases and a few fragments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
are in existence; of the largest, the points, and at
least a part of the casing, are either decayed, fallen
down, or broken off; for at a later time the Arabs
used these monuments as quarries. Three pyramids
which stand in the neighbourhood of the modern
Abusir are formed of rough blocks of stone, both in
the cores and in the passages to the sepulchral
chambers; and these blocks are fastened together by
mud from the Nile poured in between them; their
casings, now decayed, were of lime-stone blocks,
and in height they extended from 150 to 200 feet.
Others, originally at least, of an equal height, of
which the core was regularly built of brick, are found
farther to the south near Dahshur. The architecture
of these remains shows that the kings of Memphis
commenced building their tombs soon after their
accession. They began, it would seem, with a core
of moderate size, and in this they probably constructed
a sort of temporary chamber. If time
sufficed, the first plan was overlaid with new strata,
and thus it gradually increased in size. Should the
builder die before the whole was completed, the
casing of the structure thus raised in the form of
steps was left to the successor.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Between seven smaller
pyramids, built regularly of stone blocks, which are
about 150 feet in height, and of similar plan and
structure, rise the three largest at Gizeh; the highest
was originally 480 feet in height, though now it
measures only 450 feet; the next greatest, standing
south-west of the highest, is now 447 feet, and was
originally 457 feet in height; the third measures
but 218 feet. The second largest, originally twenty-three
feet lower than the largest, is on a slightly
higher level, the masonry is inferior to the largest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and the chamber lies immediately under the area
of the structure. The largest measures 716 feet,
or 500 Egyptian cubits,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> on each side of the area;
the height along the slope is 574 feet, and the
structure contains about ninety million cubic feet of
masonry. Fifty feet above the original area, now
covered with the sand of the desert, in the middle
of the north side, there commences a gradually
descending passage, about three feet broad and four
feet high, leading to a chamber hewn deep in the
foundation rock. This chamber lies more than one
hundred feet below the level of the pyramid, exactly
600 feet under the apex, and in a perpendicular line
with it; it is thirty-six feet above the level of the
Nile. From this passage to the chamber there
branches off, just behind the entrance, a horizontal
shaft, and from this rises an ascending passage
leading to two chambers, one over the other, which,
like the sepulchral chamber below, lie in the axis
of the pyramid. The third and smaller pyramid&mdash;its
sides measure 333 feet, and the height of the
slope is 262 feet&mdash;being built upon looser soil,
required a greater substructure, on which it rose
in five or six perpendicular and gradually diminishing
stories, the spaces between being filled up with
bevelled masonry. Up to a considerable height the
casing consists of polished slabs of granite. Under
this structure in the native rock lies a larger chamber,
and behind this the sepulchral chamber.</p>

<p>When Herodotus visited Egypt about the middle of
the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, and questioned his interpreter
and guide about the builders of these three pyramids,
he was told in answer that they were built by Cheops,
Chephren, and Mycerinus. He was told that Cheops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
first caused a road to be made from the stone quarries
in the Arabian chain of hills&mdash;the range east of the
Nile&mdash;down to the river, and again from the west side
of the river to the high ground above Memphis. The
road was built of smoothed stones five stades in length,
ten fathoms broad, and at the highest places thirty-two
fathoms high; and it was intended to convey the
materials from the Arabian side of the river. In
making this road and building the subterranean
chamber for the grave of Cheops ten years were
consumed, although 100,000 men were constantly
employed upon it by spaces of three months, when
they were relieved by an equal number of fresh
workmen. Twenty years were then spent upon the
pyramid, of which each side and the height measured
800 feet; it was built in such a manner that the
structure was carried out by landings and steps, like
a staircase. When the proper height was reached,
the landings were covered from top to bottom with
smoothed and carefully-fitted stones, and no stone is
less than thirty feet. Under the surface was a canal
carried in masonry from the Nile round the subterranean
chamber. "It is also inscribed on the pyramid,"
Herodotus continues, "what the workmen consumed
in radishes, onions, and garlic, and on these, as
I well remember, the interpreter who read the letters
told me, 1,600 talents of silver were spent. If this is
true, what must have been expended upon iron for
the tools, and on food and clothing for the workmen?"
When Cheops had reigned fifty years he was succeeded
by his brother Chephren, who also built a pyramid,
though not equal in size to the other, and without
any chamber or subterranean canal. "Both pyramids
stand on the same elevation, of about one hundred
feet; but the second is forty feet lower than the first;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the lower stratum is built of vari-coloured Ethiopian
stone." When Chephren had reigned fifty-six years,
he was followed by Mycerinus, the son of Cheops.
This king also left a pyramid behind him, "but his
pyramid was much smaller than that built by his
father: the sides are only 280 feet in length; the
lower half is built of Ethiopian stone."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The account of Diodorus is as follows:&mdash;King
Chemmis of Memphis reigned fifty years, and built
the largest of the three pyramids, which in height
measures more than six plethra, and along the sides
more than seven plethra. It is entirely constructed
of solid stone, very difficult to work, and therefore of
endless durability. Even now, although not less than a
thousand, or as some say even more than 3,400, years
have passed, the structure is uninjured, and the joints
of the stones unloosened. Besides, we are told that
these stones were brought from a considerable distance
out of Arabia, and the structure was carried to its
present height by means of mounds of earth. Most
wonderful of all, no traces of these mounds, no
fragments from the hewing and smoothing of the
stones remain; so that it would seem that this work
was not accomplished gradually by the hand of man,
but was planted complete by a god in the midst of
the surrounding sand. Though it is said that 360,000
men bestowed their labour on the structure, the work
can hardly have been finished in twenty years, and
the number of men who erected it must also have
removed the mounds of earth and excavated material,
and put everything in its original condition. Chemmis
was followed by his brother Kephren, who
reigned fifty-six years. Other accounts tell us that
the kingdom descended on his son, Chabryes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
not on his brother. But all agree that he built the
second pyramid, which resembles the first in the art of
the execution, though much inferior in size, since on
the sides it measures only one stadium (or, according
to recent measurement, exactly 700&frac12; Greek feet). And
while the money spent in radishes and garden herbs
for the builders is inscribed on the larger one, the
smaller remains without any inscription. Though
both these kings had destined these tombs for
their place of burial, neither is buried there. Roused
by the burden of their labours, the cruelty and violence
of these kings&mdash;and in Herodotus also Cheops
and Chephren appear as wicked and godless kings&mdash;the
people threatened to take their bodies out
of their graves and insult them. Terrified by this
threat, each of the kings in his last moments bade his
relations bury him privately in a secret place. After
Kephren reigned Mycerinus, whom others call Mencherinus,
the son of Chemmis. He built the smallest
pyramid. Though less in size, it surpasses the others
in the excellence of the work and the beauty of the
stone; up to the fifteenth layer it consists of black
stone resembling the stone of Thebes; from thence to
the top the stone is the same as in the other pyramids.
On the north side is written the name of the builder,
Mycerinus. Abhorring the cruelty of his predecessors,
Mycerinus, as we learn, sought to make his
rule moderate and beneficent to his subjects, and did
everything to gain the affections of the nation. He
paid great attention to the administration of justice;
and to the common people who had not received from
the tribunals such a sentence as seemed just to him,
he made presents. "But as to the building of the
pyramids, there is no agreement either among the
Egyptians or their historians; some ascribe them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to the kings I have mentioned; some to other
kings."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The accounts given by Herodotus and Diodorus of
the structure of the largest pyramid are completely
confirmed by modern researches. Even now it is
thought that traces can be recognised of the causeway
which served for the transport of the materials from
the left bank of the Nile to the plateau.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The pyramid
itself is built in large regular steps constructed of
squares of granite. The yellow lime-stone of the casing
must also have been really brought from the Arabian
side of the Nile, because better stone of that kind was
found there.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> On the other hand, the account of a
subterranean canal round the grave chamber is merely
a legend of the people, who desired to adorn with new
marvels the structure already so marvellous; it is
impossible, simply because the lower chamber, and not
only the area of the pyramid, is above the lower level
of the Nile. The 100,000 workmen of Herodotus,
changed every three months, and the 360,000 of
Diodorus&mdash;a number formed from the days in the old
Egyptian year&mdash;have arisen out of the free invention
of later times, although the building must certainly
have occupied more than a decade of years. Inscriptions
are not found now on the external side of the
pyramid. If such were in existence at the time of
Herodotus, they certainly contained other things than
those which the interpreter pretended to read there.
The interpreters who served as guides to the travellers
of that day in Egypt, as the dragoman does now, could
hardly have read the hieroglyphics; they contented
themselves with narrating the traditions and stories
popularly connected with the great monuments of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
past time, not without certain exaggerations and
additions.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>But the names of the builders of the three largest
pyramids, which these interpreters mentioned to the
Greeks, are confirmed by the monuments. In the deep
chamber of the largest pyramid there is no sarcophagus;
in the upper of the two chambers which lie in the axis
of the pyramid there has been found, it is true, a
simple sarcophagus of red granite, but it bears no
inscription. Above these chambers, however, there
are certain small spaces left open, with a view no
doubt of diminishing the pressure of the stone-work
upon them, and on the walls of these spaces is
written the name, Chufu, Chnemu Chufu, in hieratic
characters.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The same name frequently recurs in the
tombs surrounding this pyramid, in which, according
to the inscriptions, the wives, sons, officers, and priests
of Chufu were buried; and among them the scribe of
the buildings of the kings and the priest of Apis, who
was at the same time keeper of the gates and of the
palace. In this inscription the pyramid of Chufu is
called "Chut." On a monumental stone found in the
Apis tombs&mdash;now in Cairo&mdash;we read, "The living
Horus, the King of Egypt, Chufu, has built a temple
to Isis near the temple of the Sphinx, north of
the temple of Osiris, and has erected his pyramid
beside the temple of Isis."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Chufu himself is not
found in Egypt, but in the peninsula of Sinai he is
pictured in relief on the rocks in the Wadi Maghara.
He is represented as lifting his war-club against an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
enemy whom he has forced upon his knee and
seized by the head-dress with the left hand.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In an
inscription in the same valley, the oldest which we
possess, his predecessor Snefru claims to have subjugated
these regions.</p>

<p>In the second pyramid, in the chamber under the
surface, a sarcophagus of granite has been discovered on
the floor without any inscription. But in the inscriptions
on the graves, especially on the grave of the
architect of King Chafra, his pyramid is mentioned
as "the great pyramid." Between the paws of the
Sphinx which stands to the north of the second
pyramid, hewn out of the living rock, is a monumental
stone, on which is read the name Chafra,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and in the
ruins of a temple lying near the Sphinx&mdash;the same
without doubt which is mentioned in the stone at
Cairo&mdash;seven statues have been exhumed, the inscriptions
on which prove that they represent "the
Master and Gold Horus, Chafra, the good god, the
lord of the crown," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, King Chafra himself.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> And
lastly, the inscriptions on the tomb of a woman whose
name is read as Mertitef, prove that she was the chief
favourite of Snefru and of Chufu, and had been
united to Chafra.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Hence Chafra must have succeeded
Chufu, and the "great" pyramid built by him can
hardly have been any other than that which now holds
the second place.</p>

<p>In the sepulchral chamber of the third pyramid, it
is known in the inscriptions as "Har," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, "the
supreme," the sarcophagus of King Menkera with his
mummy has been discovered. It is made of blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
basalt, and bears the following inscription:&mdash;"O
Osiris, King Menkera, ever living one; begotten of
the sky, carried in the bosom of Nut, scion of Seb
(<a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>). Thy mother Nut is outstretched over thee,
in her name of the mystery of the sky may she
deify thee and destroy thy enemies, King Menkera,
ever living one."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore an ascertained fact that Chufu, Chafra,
and Menkera were the builders of the three great
pyramids. In the mouth of the Greeks the name
Chufu passed into Cheops, and by a farther change
into Suphis. The name Chemmis in Diodorus has
arisen out of the name Chnemu in the form Chnemu
Chufu; from Chafra naturally arose Chephren, Kephren,
and Chabryes. In the list of kings in Eratosthenes,
the fourteenth successor of Menes is Saophis; Eratosthenes
allows him a reign of twenty-nine years. His
successor, who has a reign of twenty-seven years, bears
the same name. The second Saophis is followed by
Moscheres with a reign of thirty-one years. Manetho's
list gives the name Suphis to the twenty-seventh king
after Menes, and he is said to have reigned sixty-three
years. Then follows a second Suphis, with a reign
of sixty-six years, and this king is succeeded by
Menchres, who reigned sixty-three years. On the
first Suphis in Manetho's list the excerpt of Africanus
remarks: "This king built the largest pyramid,
which Herodotus assigns to the time of Cheops;"
in the excerpt of Eusebius, both in the Greek
text and the Armenian translation, this remark is
made on the second Suphis. Hence we can have no
hesitation in identifying the Cheops and Chephren of
Herodotus, the Chemmis and Kephren of Diodorus,
with the first and second Saophis and Sufis of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
lists, the Chufu and Chafra of the inscriptions; and
the Mycerinus of Herodotus and Diodorus is beyond
doubt the same as the Moscheres of Eratosthenes, the
Mencheres of Manetho, and the Menkera of the
sarcophagus in the third pyramid. In the national
tradition of the Egyptians, as received by the Greeks,
Cheops and Chephren were called brothers, and this
is no doubt mainly due to the fact that the monuments
of these two kings surpassed all the other pyramids,
and were of nearly the same height and size.  It
is impossible that Cheops should have reigned
fifty years, and his brother Chephren who succeeded
him, fifty-six years, as Herodotus and Diodorus
tell us&mdash;the inscription quoted above makes the same
woman the favourite of the predecessor of Chufu,
of Chufu, and Chafra also; even more impossible is
it that the first Suphis should have reigned sixty-three
years, and the second sixty-six, as given in
the list of Manetho, if they were brothers; or that
Mycerinus, whom Herodotus as well as Diodorus
calls the son of Cheops, should have succeeded
Chephren with a reign of sixty-three years, as
Manetho tells us.  Like their brotherhood, the
wickedness of Cheops and Chephren is due to the
popular legends of later times. The sight of the
enormous structures forced on later generations the
reflection what labour, what stupendous efforts must
have been necessary for their erection. This reflection
united with certain dim memories, and gathered round
the rule of the strangers, the shepherd-tribes, which for
a long time afflicted Egypt, as is clear enough from a
trait in the narrative of Herodotus. He assures us
that the Egyptians could scarcely be induced to mention
the names of the kings who built the great pyramids:
they spoke of them as the works of the shepherd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Philitis.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In the eyes of the Egyptians of the olden
time, tombs would never have appeared to be works of
impiety and wickedness, realising as they did in such
an extraordinary degree the object most eagerly desired,
a secure and indestructible resting-place for the dead:
with them they would rather pass as works of singular
piety. Without doubt it is the older tradition, that
of the priests, which meets us in the observation
appended in the list of Manetho and the excerpt of
Africanus to the first Suphis, and in the excerpt of
Eusebius, both in the Greek text and Armenian translation,
to the second Suphis, in which we are told
that this king had composed a sacred book, and the
Egyptians regarded it as a very great treasure.</p>

<p>According to the inscription, Chufu had erected a
temple to Isis by the side of the temple of the
Sphinx, and therefore the latter temple must have
been already in existence. And as a fact the ruins
still found beside the great Sphinx give evidence of
very ancient workmanship. There was a court, the
ante-court of the temple, which surrounded a portico
supported on twelve square pillars; next came a hall
supported on monoliths, the temple itself, and finally
the Holy of Holies, surrounded by small chambers.
The material used in building was limestone and
granite. The symbolic form of the deity, to whom the
temple belonged, was the enormous Sphinx, 190 feet in
length, hewn out of the rock, with the body of a lion
and the head of a man. From the memorial stone before
it we learn that it symbolized the god Harmachu
(Armachis of the Greeks), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Horus in Splendour
(<i>har-em-chu</i>).<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> From the inscription on this stone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
which dates from the time of Tuthmosis IV., it seems
to follow that it was Chafra, who caused this shape to
be hewn out of the rock and consecrated it to the
god. Other inscriptions inform us that the pyramids
were regarded as sepulchral temples, and that there
were priests for the service of the princes who were
buried there, and had attained to a divine nature,
and these services were still in existence at the
time of the Ptolemies. One of the tombs at Gizeh
belongs to a priest, a relation of Chafra, whose duty
it was to "honour the pyramid Uer (the Great) of king
Chafra;" another is found at Sakkarah belonging to
"a priest of Chufu, and Chafra."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> On a monumental
stone of the time of the Ptolemies (found in the
Serapeum, and now in the Louvre) mention is made of
the temple of Harmachu on the south of the house of
Isis, and of a certain Psamtik, the prophet of Isis, of
Osarhapi (<a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>), of Harmachu, of Chufu and Chafra.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The temples of Osiris and Isis, near the three great
pyramids, and the inscription on the sarcophagus of
king Menkera are evidence that the cultus of Osiris,
the belief in his rule in the next world, in the
return of the soul to her divine origin, and her deification
after death, was already in existence at the
time when these monuments were erected. The use
not of hieroglyphics only, but also of the hieratic
alphabet, in red and black colours, in the pyramid of
Chufu, and the graves around it, in the sculptures of
which writing materials and rolls of papyrus are
frequently engraved, the forms of domestic and household
life, of agriculture and the cultivation of the
vine, of hunting and fishing, preserved on the tombs
of Gizeh, are evidence of the long existence and
manifold development of civilisation, no less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
those great monuments, or even the graves themselves
with their artistic mode of construction, their severe
and simple style of execution, and the pleasing forms
of their ornaments. Of the seven statues of Chafra,
discovered in the temple of the Sphinx, one, chiselled
out of hard green and yellow basalt, has been preserved
uninjured. The king is represented sitting,
and naked, with the exception of a covering on the
head and a girdle round the loins. The lower arms
rest on the thighs, the left hand is outstretched, the
right holds a fillet. The sides of the cube, on which
Chafra is seated, are formed by lions, between the feet
of which are stems of papyrus. On the high back of
the chair, behind the head of the king, sits the hawk
of Horus, whose wings are spread forwards in an
attitude of protection. The execution of the statue
of the king is a proof of long practice in sculpture.
The natural form is truly and accurately rendered,
and though even here Egyptian art displays its
characteristic inclination to severity, and correctness
in the proportions of the body, to repose and dignity,
yet in the head there is an unmistakable attempt
to individualize an outline already fixed&mdash;an attempt
not without success.  Still more distinctly individual
are two statues found near the pyramids of
Meidum, from the reign of the predecessor of Chufu,
a wooden statue, and certain pictures in relief from
the tombs near the great pyramids. The architecture,
no less than the sculpture, of these most ancient
monuments, displays a high degree of experience and
a knowledge of the principles of art, a conscious purpose
and effort existing together with a fixed obedience
to rule.</p>

<p>We learnt from Diodorus that the great pyramids
were erected 1,000, or, according to some, 3,400<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
years before his time. According to the list of
Manetho, Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus belonged
to the fourth dynasty. If we accept the incredible
reigns of sixty-three, sixty-six, and again, sixty-three
years, which Manetho allows to those three kings,
they reigned over Egypt, according to Lepsius' dates,
from the year 3095 <small>B.C.</small>, to 2903 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>At a period subsequent to these kings the list of
Manetho speaks in the sixth dynasty of a king
Phiops, who came to the throne as a child in his
sixth year, and lived to be 100 years old. The list
of Erastosthenes mentions a king Apappus, who
reigned for 100 years. The monuments show us a
king Pepi, in whom we recognise Phiops and Apappus,
and in consequence a reign of ninety-five years
is assigned to him (2654-2559 <small>B.C.</small>). Yet hitherto
the sixteenth year is the highest found on the monuments
for the reign of Pepi; and in the inscription on
a tomb at Abydus, now in the museum at Cairo, a
man of the name of Una declares that he had filled
the highest offices in the kingdom under Teta, the
predecessor of Pepi, under Pepi, and again under his
successor, Merenra. If one person could be the
minister of three successive rulers, it is clear that
the second of these reigns could not have lasted
95 or 100 years. Under the reign of Pepi, as well
as his immediate predecessors and successors, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
in the sixth dynasty of Manetho, the development
of Egypt must have undergone a certain change.
The kings, previous to this family, are represented
on the monuments with a cap falling to one side,
or with a tall head-dress; Pepi is represented on
one relief with this head-dress, but on another with
one of a lower shape. The tall white cap is the
crown of Upper Egypt, the lower red one is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
crown of Lower Egypt. It is no longer on the
plateau of Memphis, and among the tombs there,
but in Middle Egypt, near El Kab, and in the valley
of Hamamat, which leads from Coptus to the Red
Sea, that we find the monuments of Pepi and his
race, and the tombs of their priests and magistrates
are at Abydus. Under this dynasty, therefore, the
central point of the kingdom appears to have been
moved from Memphis in the direction of Middle
Egypt. On the west coast of the peninsula of
Sinai, in the Wadi Maghara, Pepi is seen striking
down an enemy; and from the inscription on the tomb
of Una, it is clear that Pepi's kingdom extended up the
Nile as far as the negroes, that his successor caused dockyards
to be built in Nubia, and that Una had to procure
blocks of fine stone for the sarcophagus of Pepi
and his successor, and also for the pyramid of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The removal of the centre of the kingdom from
Memphis, which is noticeable under the family of
Pepi, was completely carried out under a later house,
which is stated in the lists to belong to Thebes&mdash;the
eleventh and twelfth dynasty of Manetho. Upper
Egypt became the seat of the royal power; Thebes
(the No-Amon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> possession of Ammon, of the
Hebrews) took her place beside Memphis. The princes
of this new dynasty are no longer called in the
monuments the lords of Upper and Lower Egypt, but
the "lords of both lands;" they always wear both
crowns. Hence it is possible that this royal house
in the first instance ruled over Upper Egypt only
from Thebes, and that for a long time Upper and
Lower Egypt existed side by side independently, till
the kings of Thebes succeeded in reducing Lower
Egypt under their dominion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Amenemha, the first king of this house, who
ruled over Upper and Lower Egypt (2380-2371 <small>B.C.</small>),
a colossal figure of red granite is still in existence,
which was discovered in Lower Egypt at Tanis
(San), not far from Lake Menzaleh.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> His power must
have extended up the Nile over the adjacent part of
Nubia, for a pillar discovered there informs us that he
intrusted an officer with the superintendence of the
gold mines in Nubia.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> His successor, Sesurtesen I.
(2371-2325 <small>B.C.</small>), erected a temple to Ammon at
Thebes, and set up obelisks, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> pointed monolithic
pillars, dedicated to the sun-god, in Lower Egypt, in
Fayum, and at Heliopolis. The obelisk at Fayum,
not far from the ancient Arsinoe, was about forty feet
in height; it has been broken by the fall into two
pieces. The obelisk of Heliopolis is sixty feet in
height; it still towers over the ruins of this city,
near the village of Matarieh. It is not the first
obelisk erected in Egypt, for the inscriptions of Chufu
mention an obelisk erected by that king, but it is
the oldest which has come down to our time. The
inscription, repeated on all four sides, runs thus:&mdash;"Horus,
the life of that which is born, the child of
the sun, Sesurtesen, who is beloved by the spirits of
Heliopolis, who will live for ever, the golden hawk,
the life of that which is born, this gracious god has
erected this obelisk at the beginning of the great
festival. He has erected it who assures us of life for
ever."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> That this king also ruled in Nubia, and
forced his way far up the Nile above Egypt, is proved
by a monument in Nubia on the cataracts of the
Wadi Halfa; a pillar, on which is depicted Sesurtesen,
representing Nubians and negroes, the prisoners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of eight nations or tribes, to the god Horus.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> In
the rock tombs of Beni Hassan is buried an officer
of this king, Amenj, overseer of the canton of Hermopolis
(Ashmunein). The inscription tells us that
Amenj had served the king when on a campaign
to destroy his enemies; that he had approached
the land of Cush, and reached the limits of the
earth. The king had returned in peace after the
overthrow of his enemies. Afterwards Amenj with
600 warriors had conveyed the produce of the goldmines
from the canton of Hermopolis to the stronghold
of Coptus. He had loved his canton; and all the
works required for the house of the king he had
carried out in his canton by his own arm, and had
paid in the tribute. He had laboured, and the canton
had been in full activity. He had not afflicted
the children, or ill-treated the widows; he had not
disturbed the fishermen, or hindered the herdsmen.
Famine had never prevailed, because every plot
had been planted. He had caused the inhabitants
to live, had given gifts without regarding the great
before the small.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The fragment of a seated colossus
of Sesurtesen I., of black granite, is to be seen in
the museum at Berlin; his colossus of red granite is
at Tanis. A third statue of this king has been found
at Abydus.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Amenemha II. and Sesurtesen II. carried on the
campaigns of the first Sesurtesen in the south of
Egypt. A monument in the valley of Hamamat
exhibits battles with the Punt, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> with the tribes of
the Arabians and the negroes.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Sesurtesen III., who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
succeeded Sesurtesen II., completed the subjugation
of Lower Nubia. To protect the new border of the
kingdom, he caused fortresses to be erected a little
above the falls of the Wadi Halfa, at Semne and
Kumne, about 250 miles south of Syene. A pillar
discovered in this district has the following inscription:&mdash;"Southern
border; erected in the eighth year,
under the rule of his holiness King Sesurtesen III.,
who gives life for all eternity. No negro shall pass
over it on his way, except the boats laden with the
oxen, goats, and asses of the negroes."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>The third Sesurtesen was followed by the third
Amenemha (2221 to 2179 <small>B.C.</small>). Inscriptions in the
Wadi Maghara, in the peninsula of Sinai, tell us that
Amenemha III. caused the copper to be conveyed from
the mines there by 734 soldiers, in the second year of
his reign; and inscriptions in the valley of Hamamat
show that the quarries there were frequently used by
this king.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Near the fortifications of his predecessor,
on the rocks of Semne and Kumne, are found
numerous records of the height reached by the Nile
in the reign of Amenemha III. Here we read&mdash;"Level
of Hapi (the Nile) in the fourteenth, sixteenth,
thirtieth years, &amp;c., under his holiness King Amenemha
III., who lives for ever." From these observations
we find that the average height of the inundations
at that time was more than twenty-four feet higher
than at present; and the greatest height reached
under Amenemha III. was twenty-seven feet above
the greatest height of modern times.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus tells us the following story;&mdash;Among
the successors of Menes, Moeris carried out some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
remarkable works; he built the north gateway in
the temple of Hephaestus, excavated a great lake,
and erected pyramids in it. "The priests told me that
under the rule of Moeris, the Nile overflowed the
land below Memphis, although it had only risen to
the height of eight cubits, but now the water does not
cover the land unless it reaches a height of sixteen
or at least fifteen cubits; and it seems to me that if
the land were raised again in the same proportion,
the Egyptians who live in the Delta below the lake of
Moeris would be in distress. The circuit of the lake
of Moeris is about 3,600 stades, or sixty schoenes,
and the depth in the deepest place about fifty fathoms.
The lake extends from north to south. That it was
the work of human hands, is clear from the nature
of it. About the middle are two pyramids, each of
which rises about fifty fathoms out of the water, and
on each is a stone colossus seated on a throne. The
water of the lake does not arise from springs, for
the whole district there is entirely without water,
it is introduced by a canal from the Nile. For
six months the water flows from the Nile into the
lake, and again for six months from the lake into the
Nile. While it runs out the fishery brings in a talent
of silver a day for the King's treasury; but when the
water flows into the lake the product is a third of a
talent only.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>"</p>

<p>Diodorus tells us that king Moeris erected the
north gateway at Memphis, the splendour of which
excelled all others; and above the city at about ten
schoenes distance he excavated a lake of marvellous
utility and incredible size. The circuit was 3,600
stades, and the depth in most places was fifty
fathoms. "Who would not ask, when contemplating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the vast extent of this work, how many myriads of men
were required to complete it, and for how many years?
But no one could ever speak in worthy terms of the
utility of the lake and the advantage it is to the
inhabitants of Egypt and the wise prudence of the
king in making it. As the Nile does not rise evenly,
and the fruitfulness of the land depends on the
evenness of the overflow, Moeris excavated this lake
to receive the superfluous water, in order that an
excessive inundation might not create marshes and
morasses, or a deficiency of water imperil the fruitfulness
of the soil. He carried a canal 300 feet in
breadth from the river for eighty stades (about ten
miles) to the lake, through which he first admitted
the superfluous water and then drew it off. In this
way he procured for the tillers of the soil the desired
medium in the water, since the mouth of the canal
was sometimes closed, sometimes opened, which
was both a difficult and costly thing to do. The
lake has remained to our time, and is still called
by the name of the constructor, the lake of Moeris.
In the middle, the king who excavated it left a place
on which he built his own tomb, and two pyramids.
One was erected for himself, the other for his wife.
On these he placed stone statues of himself and his
wife, sitting on thrones, in the impression that by
means of this work he would be for ever held in
grateful remembrance."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Of the lake above Memphis, Strabo gives the following
account:&mdash;"The canton of the city Arsinoe, which
was formerly known as the City of Crocodiles, surpasses
all others in the beauty of its appearance, in fruitfulness,
and also in the wonders to be seen there. It alone
is covered with green and large olive trees, whereas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
there are no olives in the rest of Egypt; it produces a
considerable amount of wine, and corn, and pulse, and
many other cereals. In it also lies the wonderful lake
of Moeris, which in size and colour is like a sea, and
has shores like the shores of the sea. Owing to
its size and depth this lake is able to receive the
superfluous water at the time of the inundation, so
that it does not overflow the inhabited and planted
districts. On the other hand, when the river begins to
subside, after it has poured the overflow into one of
the two mouths of the canal, the lake and the canal
together retain the water required for irrigation. This
takes place in the natural course of things, but
there are also artificial sluices at both mouths of the
canal, by which the persons in charge regulate the
rise and fall of the water." Tacitus also mentions
"the excavated lake which receives the overflow of
the Nile."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>From these accounts the object of the work is clear.
It was intended to regulate the inundation by a large
reservoir, and so to increase its beneficent effects upon
the soil of Egypt. The inundation was to be reduced
for the Delta by drawing off a part of the water,
which had risen into this basin in the neighbourhood
of Memphis, in order that the land in this district
might not be rendered swampy, and the marshes
might have time to dry. This basin could also retain
a portion of water in the superabundant years of
excessive inundation, in order to supply the deficiencies
of other years when the water did not reach the
highest plots. Further, the reservoir might be used
to irrigate the arable land in the neighbourhood during
the waterless months, when there was no inundation.</p>

<p>A few miles above Memphis the Libyan range is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
divided by a depression. This cleft leads from the
Nile into a spacious urn-shaped valley, now called
Fayum, of which the western part is filled by a large
lake. On the ruins near this lake, the name of King
Amenemha III. is frequently read. If we remember
that the careful observations of the rise of the Nile
from the reign of this king tend to show that he was
busily engaged with the irrigation of the land, that
the Egyptians call this lake the lake of inundation
(<i>meri</i>), and that the king M&#339;ris of the Greeks owes
his name to this title (<i>suten en meri</i>), we may regard
Amenemha III. as the author of the wonderful
hydraulic structures at Fayum. The great reservoir,
which he constructed, is no longer in existence, but
the remains of it can be traced in dams and in the
modern lake of Fayum, the Birket-el-Kerun. The urn-shaped
valley of Fayum offered a situation for a basin
near the Nile, which might receive and preserve part of
the inundation, and the depression in the Libyan range
secured a natural path for the canal, required to feed
the basin from the Nile, and the Nile from the basin.
For the site of the basin the nearest part of the
valley was selected; it was enough that the bed of
the reservoir was not lower than the lowest level of
the Nile. No deep excavations were needed; all that
was required was to enclose a large part of the valley
with strong dams; and the earth necessary for erecting
these could be taken out of the enclosed space. These
dams must have been massive enough to retain a large
body of water, and prevent it from breaking out into
the western, and far lower part of the valley, and at
the same time of sufficient height to prevent any
overflow even in the times of the highest inundations.
At the eastern entrance into Fayum we find running
from the valley of the Nile the remains of long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
rectilinear, and very massive banks, in which modern
research has recognised the original enclosure of the
lake of Moeris. The breadth of the dams appears to
have been carried to 150 feet; whereas the height can
hardly have exceeded thirty feet.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> When Herodotus
tells us that the depth of the basin in the deepest part
was fifty fathoms, it is obvious that the statement
rests on the computation that the two pyramids in the
middle of the lake were of the same height under as
above the surface. The same authority allows a
circuit of about 450 miles for the lake, but from the
remains we cannot allow a greater circuit than 150
miles.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The Egyptians were sufficiently skilled in the
erection of strong dams, and structures of such an
extent could not be in excess of the resources of a
country which had erected the great pyramids.
Finally, when Herodotus asks what had become of the
earth dug out of this great lake, the answer is that
there was no complete excavation, but merely the
enclosure of a certain space of land, and what was
taken out of this was at once applied to the construction
of the dams.</p>

<p>The statement of the priests about the height of the
inundation in the reign of Moeris, which Herodotus
has preserved for us, and from which he has drawn
the conclusion that the soil of Lower Egypt must
have risen since that reign from seven to eight cubits in
height, is much exaggerated. The deposit of mud in
consequence of the inundation raises the soil only
about four inches in 100 years, that is, about three-and-a-quarter
feet in 1,000 years. Supposing the basin of
Amenemha to have been completed 1,500 years before
Herodotus travelled in Egypt, the difference in the
required height of the inundation might reach three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
or four cubits, but not seven or eight. Yet the raising
of the soil, and more especially of the bed of the
great basin, which rose far more rapidly than the
surface of the land, brought about the decay, and at
last the ruin, of this reservoir. The bed of the basin
in which the water remained the whole year through,
and not for three or four months only, must have been
raised by the deposit at a peculiarly rapid rate; at
the present time it shows a height of eleven feet as
compared with the land outside the remains of the
dams.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> With this rise in the bed, the value of the
basin diminished in proportion as the amount of
water which the reservoir was capable of receiving
was lessened. It was useless to raise the height of
the dams, for the influx of the water from the Nile
depended on the level of the bed of the connecting
canal, and of the basin. These causes along with the
disaffection of later times must have brought about the
decay of the reservoir, the value of which Diodorus
places so high, and which was in existence in the time
of Tacitus. At a later period the dams must have
been neglected, so that at the time of some extraordinary
inundation, a breach was made towards the
west, which filled the western and lowest part of
Fayum with water. This is the origin of the Birket-el-Kerun,
the water of which is still sufficient to convert
the largest part of Fayum into one of the most fertile
and blooming districts of Egypt. The level of the
Birket-el-Kerun is seventy feet lower than the canal
which once connected the reservoir with the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>"A little above Lake Moeris," Herodotus tells us,
"at the so-called City of the Crocodiles, is the labyrinth.
I have seen it, and it outdoes its reputation.
If any one were to put together the walls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
buildings of the Hellenes, he would find that they were
surpassed in labour and cost by this labyrinth alone,
although the temples at Ephesus and Samos are
certainly well worth speaking of. The pyramids are
indeed beyond all description, and each of them is
equivalent to many of the greatest works of Hellas,
but the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids. It
contains twelve roofed courts, abutting on each other,
the entrances to which are opposite, six to the north
and six to the south. Externally they are all included
in one wall. The chambers are of two kinds,
some are under the ground, others visible above it; of
each kind there are 1,500. Those above ground I
have passed through, and can speak of them from eyesight;
those under the ground the Egyptian overseers
could not be induced to show me, because, as they
said, they contained the sepulchres of the kings who
built the labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. Of
these, therefore, I can only speak from hearsay: but
the chambers above ground, which I saw, are a superhuman
work. The entrances through the covered
spaces, and the windings through the courts are
very complicated, and excite infinite wonder, as
you pass from the courts into the chambers, and from
the chambers into colonnades, and from these into
other covered spaces, and from the chambers into
other courts. On all these spaces lies a roof of
stone, similar to the walls; the walls are covered
with carved pictures, and each court is surrounded on
the inside with pillars of white stones, excellently
fitted together. In the angle where the labyrinth
ends there is a pyramid forty fathoms high, with
large figures cut into it. The entrance to this is
under the surface."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Diodorus says:&mdash;"One of the old kings, named
Menas, built on the lake of Moeris, the City of Crocodiles,
a tomb for himself, a square pyramid, and the
marvellous labyrinth." In another passage he says:
"King Mendes, whom some call Marrhus, was not
distinguished by any military achievements, but he
built for his tomb the so-called labyrinth, which is
marvellous not so much for its size as for the inimitable
art of the structure. Without a thoroughly competent
guide, it would not be easy for any one to find his
way out." And in a third passage we are told: "The
labyrinth at the entrance into Lake Moeris is a
square structure&mdash;each side measuring a stadium&mdash;built
of the most beautiful stone, unsurpassed in the
sculptures and the art bestowed upon it." "Passing
through the enclosure, you see a house surrounded with
pillars, forty on each side, and with a roof of a single
stone, adorned with mullions in relief, and various paintings.
It also contains the monuments of the twelve
provinces of Egypt of their sacred relics and sacrifices,
all represented in the most excellent pictures."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Strabo's account is as follows:&mdash;"At the sluices (of
the canal connecting the basin and the lake) is the
labyrinth, a work as great as the pyramids, and
moreover the grave of the king who built it. About
thirty or forty stades above the mouth of the canal is
a table-land, on which lies a hamlet and a palace made
up of as many palaces as there are districts in Egypt.
For so many in number are the colonnaded courts,
adjoining each other in a row, and abutting on a
partition against which they are built as against a
long wall.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The entrances which lead to them are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
over against the wall. Before these entrances lie dark
chambers, long in shape, and numerous, which are
connected with each other by winding passages, so that
without a guide it is impossible for the stranger to find
the entrance or exit belonging to each court. The
most marvellous thing is that the roof of each chamber
consists of a single stone. Even the dark passages
(before the entrances into the courts) are covered with
slabs of a single stone, from side to side, without use
of wood or other support, and these slabs are of extraordinary
size. If you go out on the roof, and as there
is but one story, it is not high, you find before you a
plateau of stones of this kind. If from this point you
look again into the courts, you see them twenty-seven
in number in a row, supported by pillars of a single
stone. The walls also are of stones not less in size.
This number of courts are said to have been erected
because it was the custom for all the districts to assemble
here by their representatives, with their priests and
animals for sacrifice, in order to offer sacrifice and decide
matters of the greatest importance. Each district
thus met in its own court. At the end of the structure,
which extends over more than a stadium (in the
square), lies the tomb, a square pyramid, of which
each side is about a plethron in length and the same
in height. The king buried there is called Ismandes."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>"The labyrinth," remarks Pliny, "is still existing
in Egypt, though it is said to have been erected more
than 3,600 years. Lykeas calls it the tomb of Moeris;
some authorities assert that it is a shrine of the Sun-god,
and this is the general belief. The entrance was
built of Parian marble, which is astonishing to me,
the remainder of joined blocks of granite, which
centuries have not been able to destroy, albeit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
assisted by the inhabitants of Heracleopolis, who
regard this structure with the greatest detestation,
and treat it accordingly. The plan of the whole and
the various parts it is impossible to describe. It is
divided according to the districts and prefectures,
which they call nomes; these are twenty-five in
number, and their names are given to an equal
number of large buildings. Besides this it contains a
temple of all the gods of Egypt, and includes above
1,500 small buildings. The chambers are lofty, and
each colonnade is ascended by a flight of ninety steps.
Within are pillars of porphyry, images of the gods,
statues of the kings, and monstrous shapes. Through
the greater part you pass in darkness. From the
wing attached to the labyrinth, passages lead through
the rock to underground chambers, and there is also
a pyramid belonging to it."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>As we have seen, Diodorus in one passage ascribes
the building of the labyrinth to the ancient king
Menas, and in another to king Mendes, whom other
authorities call Marrhus, and at last he says that the
twelve kings, who reigned in Egypt after the dominion
of the Ethiopians, built the labyrinth for their common
sepulchre. Four hundred years before his time Herodotus
had stated that the twelve kings built it as a
common memorial of their reign. Lykeas mentioned
king Moeris as the builder, and Strabo told us that
the king buried in it was Ismandes, a name which would
agree with the Mendes of Diodorus. According to the
lists of Manetho, it was the fourth ruler of the twelfth
dynasty&mdash;Lacharis in the excerpt of Africanus, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Lamaris in that of Eusebius&mdash;who built the labyrinth
in the province of Arsinoe for his own sepulchre.</p>

<p>The Menas of Diodorus may be an abbreviation of
Amenemha, and this supposition becomes the more
probable because the king called Moeris by the
Greeks is mentioned as a builder of the labyrinth.
The remains of the building, on the north side of
which the pyramid is still standing, raise this supposition
into a certainty. At the entrance to this pyramid,
on the pillars and architraves in the ruins, the name
of Amenemha III. is repeatedly found.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>We must assume, therefore, that in the district which
he had recovered from the desert by means of his large
reservoir, king Amenemha built a large national temple
close to the basin, and in this temple it was intended
that all the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt should
see the deities of their land reproduced in separate courts
and temples. Then the Egyptians may have ascribed
a restoration of this imperial temple, this pantheon, to
the supposed twelve kings who were thought to have
reigned after the Ethiopian dominion. This tradition is
obviously at the bottom of the accounts of Herodotus
and Diodorus, who carry the building back to the seventh
century <small>B.C.</small> The ruins of the labyrinth lie near the
modern village of Hauara, among orchards and palm
groves, beside rose gardens and sugar plantations, surrounded
by fruitful fields, in a district which is still
flourishing and covered with villages, bounded to the
west by naked ridges of rock and the sand of the
desert. They consist of blocks of granite and dazzling
white limestone, which explains the supposed Parian
marble in Pliny, the remains of walls and the
capitals of pillars. The extent of the structure
reaches 600 feet in length and 500 in width; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
traces of numerous chambers, some large and some very
small, but all rectangular, are still visible both above
and under the ground. In the centre is a clear space,
once perhaps filled by the courts, of which Herodotus
enumerates twelve and Strabo twenty-seven. The
pyramid consists of a core built of bricks, and was
cased with sculptures, of which, however, there are
very slight remains; each side measured 300 feet in
length. It was the sepulchre of Amenemha; here,
among his great creations, he lay at rest.</p>

<p>In addition to the monuments in Nubia, and this
great building, the lake which ripples against the labyrinth
is a most eloquent witness of the prosperity to
which this dynasty of the Amenemha and Sesurtesen
raised Egypt. The population must have been already
very numerous when it came to recovering fresh land
from the desert, and attention was turned towards increasing
and improving the rich fertilization which
nature every year secured for Egypt. The picture of
the richly developed cultivation, of which these structures
exhibit the highest point, is supplemented by
the insight into the details of the circumstances of
the country permitted by the rock tombs of Beni
Hassan, Bersheh, and Sioot (in Central Egypt), which
belong to this period of Egyptian history. At Beni
Hassan, where the tombs go back to the reign of the
first Sesurtesen, we see the entire process of agriculture.
Oxen or slaves are drawing the ploughs, of which five
different kinds are in use. Sheep and goats tread the
seed into the ground. The corn when cut is gathered
into sheaves, trodden out by oxen, measured, and
carried in sacks to the granary. The flax is packed
upon the backs of asses, the lotus, the vintage, and the
figs are gathered in. The vintage is partly trodden
out, partly squeezed in a press moved by a lever; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
wine is poured into jars, and carried into a cellar. We
see the irrigation of the fields, the planting of the
gardens, the cultivation of onions, the overseer and
his clerks. The overseer passes sentence on the lazy
and negligent slaves: when he has heard the complaint
and the answer, he orders the bastinado to be
applied to the culprits, and hands to his master
the written account of the matter. With equal
minuteness we can follow the breeding of cattle. We
see fine herds of oxen, cows, and calves, asses, sheep,
and goats in the stalls or at pasture with their
keepers; we see the cows milked, the butter and
cheese prepared. The fowl-yards are filled with a
multitude of different ducks and geese. In the same
way by following the pictures on the graves at Beni
Hassan we can obtain an accurate view of the process
of the various manufactures. We see the spinners
and weavers at work; we can follow the potter
through all the stages of his work, from the first
kneading of the clay to the burning of the finished
jar. The carpenter and joiner, the currier, the shoemaker,
the smith and goldsmith, the mason and painter,
pursue their occupations before our eyes. We see
rudders, lances, javelins, bows and arrows, clubs and
war-axes preparing: and lastly we have the manufacture
of glass, even the blowing, in all the various
operations before us. With similar minuteness we can
see the interior of the Egyptian house, simply or
splendidly furnished, with all the movable goods, the
dogs, cats, and apes belonging to the inhabitants;
there are the servants at their work, and the operations
of the kitchen in great detail. Further we find
soldiers of every rank, and with all kinds of weapons;
we see them exercising military drill; the battle, the
siege, the ram, which is brought up against the walls of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the enemy, the roof of shields under which the besieging
army advanced to storm the wall&mdash;all these are before
us. Birding is carried on by means of traps and nets,
angling by hooks and spears of two or three tines;
there is hunting in its various modes. Long rows of
wrestlers exhibit all the various positions of their sport,
which seems to have been much in vogue; along
with this various games exhibiting strength or endurance
were carried on; among others, games of ball and
mora. We see dancers, male and female, in various
and sometimes very intricate positions; harps and
flutes of very different shapes are played upon.
A singer is accompanied by a musician on a
harp, and the concert is completed by two choruses,
one of men, the other of women, who clap their
hands. The better class are depicted in gaily-coloured
skiffs and palanquins, surrounded by numerous servants,
among whom may be observed a considerable
number of negroes. Dwarfs and deformed persons are
also found in their train.</p>

<p>The most splendid tomb at Beni Hassan belongs to
Chnumhotep, the son of Nehera, who, as the inscriptions
tell us, was a minister of Amenemha II. and
Sesurtesen II. Like Amenj before him, he was the
overseer of the province of Hermopolis (Ashmunein).
A picture on his tomb exhibits a huge portrait of
Chnumhotep, with a staff in his hand, and a scribe at
his side; before him are a number of smaller figures,
who, to judge from their shape and clothing, are
foreigners. The chief among the foreigners, clad in a
gay garment, leads forward an antelope and makes a
reverential obeisance before the minister. His companions
are more simply clad, and armed with lances
and bows; one of them is striking a lute with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
plectrum. Four women follow, in long gaily embroidered
garments, with their heads veiled. An ass
driven by a boy with a lance carries two children,
and a second ass arms and utensils. The leaf of
papyrus, which the scribe of Chnumhotep is handing to
his master informs us that Abusa (Abscha) with thirty-six
companions from the nation of the Aamu (nomads
of the East), had brought presents to the minister of
the province of Hermopolis in the sixth year of
Sesurtesen III.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>If we compare the works of that epoch, which saw
the erection of the great pyramids, in technical and
artistic value with the remains which have come
down from the time of the Amenemha and Sesurtesen&mdash;according
to the chronology of Lepsius the two
periods are separated by an interval of six centuries&mdash;we
find in the great monuments of the first epoch, in
their passages and chambers, a dexterity in the use of
stone for building, which has never been surpassed.
The sculptures exhibit broader and stouter forms,
with more strongly-marked but well-shaped muscles.
The ornaments consist of simple, straight lines, besides
which scarcely any other adornment is found beyond
the lotus leaf. The style is composed and full of repose;
it remains nearer nature than in the later works.
In the monuments of the time of the Sesurtesen
and Amenemha the ornamentation has already become
far richer. The pillars are massive, fluted, and
crowned by a simple cube. The sculptured forms
are taller and thinner; the work in relief, carried out
with much industry and delicacy, displays at times
very happy moments of natural grace and truth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
expression, although perspective is entirely left out of
sight. Such work is always carefully painted. The
statues of limestone are also painted throughout; in
those of granite, only the clothing, the eyes and the
hair are coloured.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE HYKSOS AND THE RESTORATION OF THE EGYPTIAN<br />
KINGDOM.</h3>


<p>In spite of the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, and
the extension of the Egyptian dominion up the Nile
as far as Semne and Kumne, the kingdom of the
pyramids, of the lake of Moeris, and the labyrinth
succumbed to the attack of a foreign enemy. According
to Josephus, Manetho, in the second book of his
Egyptian History, gave the following account: "There
was a king Amyntimaeus. In his reign the divine
power, I know not why, was ungracious. From the
East came an unexpected swarm of men belonging to a
tribe of no great reputation, with a bold resolution of
taking the country. This they succeeded in doing
without much trouble. They made themselves masters
of the ruling princes, ruthlessly set fire to the cities,
and destroyed the shrines of the gods. Towards the
inhabitants they behaved in a most hostile manner;
some they put to the sword, from others they carried
away their wives and children into slavery. At last
they made one of their own number, by name Salatis,
their king. He took up his abode at Memphis, collected
tribute from the Upper and Lower country, and
placed garrisons in the most suitable places. The
eastern districts were fortified most strongly, since he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>foresaw that the Assyrians, who were then growing
in power, would be seized with the desire of invading
his country. In the Saitic (Sethroitic) province he
found a city excellently adapted for his purpose, lying
eastwards of the river from Bubastis, and called
Avaris, from some old legend or another. This he
surrounded with the strongest walls, filled it with inhabitants,
and placed there the bulk of his armed
soldiers, 240,000 men, as a garrison. In the summer
he visited this stronghold to measure the corn, pay his
soldiers, and exercise his troops in order to strike fear
in those who dwelt beyond the fortress. After a reign
of nineteen years Salatis died. After him reigned a
king of the name of Beon, for forty-four years, then
Apachnas for thirty-six years and seven months, then
Apophis for sixty-one years, and Annas for fifty years
and one month, and finally Assis for forty-nine years
and two months. These six were their first rulers, and
they sought more and more to destroy Egypt to the
very root. The whole tribe was called Hyksos, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
shepherd kings. For in the sacred language <i>hyk</i> means
'king,' and <i>sos</i> in the ordinary dialect is 'a shepherd,'
and from composition of the two comes the word Hyksos.
Some authorities say that they were Arabs." "The
shepherd kings named above and their descendants
are supposed by Manetho to have ruled over Egypt
for 511 years. Yet he afterwards tells us that kings
arose in the district of Thebes and the rest of Egypt,
between whom and the shepherds there was a long
and severe struggle. In the reign of a king named
Misphragmuthosis the shepherds were defeated by the
king, driven out of Egypt, and confined in one place,
10,000 arour&aelig; in extent, the name of which was
Avaris. This space, as Manetho tells us, the shepherds
surrounded with a great and strong wall, in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>preserve their possessions and their booty in security.
But Tuthmosis, the son of Misphragmuthosis, attempted
to take Avaris by force, and led out 480,000
men before the walls. When he found that the investment
made but little way, he came to terms with the
shepherds, permitting them to leave Egypt uninjured
and go whither they would. On these terms they
departed from Egypt with their families, and goods,
not less than 240,000 strong, and went into the Syrian
desert, and through fear of the Assyrians, who were
then the great power in Asia, they built a city in the
land now called Jud&aelig;a, large enough to contain their
numbers, and named it Jerusalem."</p>

<p>The short excerpts made by Africanus and Eusebius
from the Egyptian History of Manetho only tell that
"there were certain foreign kings, Phenicians, who took
Memphis, and built a city in the Sethroitic province,
from which they went forth and subdued the Egyptians."
Africanus gives six, Eusebius four, names of these
foreign kings, which are somewhat the same in sound
as those in Josephus, only in Africanus Apophis is the
last in the list, not last but two.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>If Josephus has transcribed and reproduced Manetho
correctly there is an obvious contradiction in his
narrative. The first shepherd king, Salatis, fortified
and peopled Avaris, and placed there a garrison of
240,000 men, for protection against the Assyrians.
Then after a lapse of 511 (or according to the excerpt
of Africanus of 953) years, when the shepherds had
lost Egypt they were shut up in a place containing
10,000 arour&aelig;, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a square of twenty-five miles, of
the name of Avaris, which they surrounded with a
strong wall in order to keep their possessions and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>booty in security. At last they were compelled to
retire even from this, and march out in just the same
strength as the garrison which Salatis had placed so
long before at Avaris, towards Jud&aelig;a, and here they
founded a second city of Jerusalem, also for protection
against the Assyrians.</p>

<p>We may leave the Assyrians out of the question,
and assume that the reference to them has been transferred
by Manetho from the later position which
Assyria took up towards Syria and Egypt in the
eighth and seventh centuries <small>B.C.</small> to those earlier
times; we may also regard the turn of the narrative,
which makes the shepherds the ancestors of the Jews
and builders of Jerusalem, as a combination invented
by Manetho, for in the tradition of the Hebrews there
is no hint that their ancestors had once ruled over
Egypt for centuries, and Jerusalem down to the time
of David was merely the stronghold of a small tribe,
the Jebusites. Still it remains inexplicable that these
shepherds, who, after they had taken Egypt, or, in
order to take it, fortified Avaris, and garrisoned it with
240,000 men, should fortify Avaris a second time
centuries later, in order to maintain their last possession
in Egypt, and at last march out of Avaris in exactly
the same numbers as the garrison originally settled
there. Shepherds, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> nomads, do not make war by
building fortresses as a base of operations for extending
their conquests; they had nothing to gain by conquering
Egypt for the mere purpose of shutting up the whole
or the greater part of their numbers with their flocks
in a fortified place. On the other hand, it might
have seemed advisable to them, when they had subjugated
Egypt, to possess a fortified place on the eastern
border, in order to keep up a connection with their
tribe; and it was natural that the shepherds, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>the Egyptians had risen against them with success,
and they were no longer able to hold the Delta,
should attempt to maintain themselves in the flats
and swamps of the Eastern Delta; and when forced to
act on the defensive should fortify their camp at
Avaris in this district.</p>

<p>In the narrative of Manetho we can accept no
more than the facts that Egypt succumbed to the
attack of the shepherds, and that they, to take the
lower estimate, ruled over Egypt for five centuries.
Herodotus also learnt in Egypt that the shepherd
Philitis had once pastured his flocks at Memphis.
There is nothing wonderful in such an occurrence.
Nomad tribes dwelt in the deserts on the east and
west of Egypt, to whose poverty and scanty means of
subsistence the abundance and cultivation of Egypt
must have presented a continual temptation. That
temptation would increase in force when the tribes
became more numerous, when unusual heat diminished
the springs in the oases, and robbed these shepherds
of the produce of their scanty agriculture. The tradition
of the Hebrews tells us that their ancestor
Abraham went to Egypt when "there was a famine
in the land," and the sons of Jacob bought corn in
Egypt.</p>

<p>According to Manetho's account, the tribes from
whom the attack proceeded were not famous, and he
regarded the invaders as coming from the east. The
peninsula of Sinai, Northern Arabia, and the Syrian
desert sheltered in the Amalekites, Horites, Edomites,
and Midianites, tribes who were rendered hardy and
warlike by life in the desert, tribal feuds, and raids
for plunder; and these may very well have united in
considerable number under some leader of military
genius, and attempted the invasion of the rich river-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>valley
in their neighbourhood. According to Manetho,
the invaders were Phenicians or Arabians. The name
of the shepherd Philitis, given by Herodotus, points
to a Semitic tribe, and one immediately bordering
on Egypt on the Syrian coast&mdash;the Philistines
(Pelischtim), from whom the whole Syrian coast was
called by the Greeks Pal&aelig;stina. The name of the
stronghold of the shepherds, Avaris, or Abaris, recurs
in Hauara, a town of Arabia on the shore of the
Red Sea.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> If the shepherds who conquered Egypt
had not been Semitic, and closely related to the
Hebrews, Manetho would not have made them the
ancestors of the Hebrews and founders of Jerusalem
after their expulsion from Egypt.</p>

<p>After the conquest, the chiefs of the shepherds
ruled over Egypt. The inscriptions on the monuments
repeatedly denote certain tribes in the east of
Egypt by the name Schasu, which in the later language
is contracted into S&ocirc;s. <i>Schasu</i> means shepherds.
Moreover, in old Egyptian, the head of a family,
a tribe, and a province is called <i>hak</i>, and Hyksos
thus can be explained by <i>Haku-schasu</i>, chiefs of the
shepherds, shepherd kings, as Josephus, Eusebius, and
Africanus render it.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> What Manetho tells us of the
destruction of the cities and shrines, the slaughter and
enslaving of the Egyptians may be correct for the
time of the war and conquest. But this hostility and
destruction cannot, as he intimates, have gone on for
centuries, for, on the restoration of the Pharaohs,
we find ancient Egypt unimpaired in population,
unchanged in language, customs, and manners, in
civilisation and art. If the national development was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>interrupted and repressed by the Hyksos, it still
remained uninjured at the core, so far as we have
the means of judging.</p>

<p>When at a subsequent period the kings of Ethiopia
subjugated Egypt, the warrior caste, the soldiers
settled in the country by the Pharaohs, were deprived
of their lands. The same thing may have taken place
on the irruption of the shepherds. The warriors of
the Pharaohs fell in battle, were carried away as
prisoners, or deprived of their weapons; and in their
place came the victorious army of the shepherds. Of
these many would soon return home laden with the
booty of Egypt, others pitched their tents in the conquered
land, and settled in the greenest meadows,
more especially in the eastern provinces of the Delta,
nearest their own home, on the Tanitic and Pelusiac
arms of the Nile, and Lake Menzaleh. The chief of
the immigrants became the head of the conquerors and
the conquered. The latter would render the same abject
homage to their new masters as they rendered before
and after to their native kings; and the power which
the conquered willingly acknowledged in the chief
would exalt his position even among the conquerors.
As time went on, the culture and civilisation of Egypt
had their natural effect on the barbarous invaders,
and when the storm of conquest was over, we may
assume that Egypt was no worse off under the rule of
the shepherd kings than at later periods under the
rule of the Persians, the Ptolemies, and the Romans.</p>

<p>That the new princes, soon after the conquest,
attempted to approximate their position as much as
possible to that of the ancient Pharaohs may be concluded
from the mere fact that Manetho was in a
position to give a catalogue of their reigns by years
and months.  But this is proved more definitely still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>by certain monuments. In the neighbourhood of Lake
Menzaleh, among the ruins of the ancient Tanis, the
modern San, two old statues have been discovered,
the forms and lineaments of which exhibit a physique
different from the Egyptian. In the heads of four
sphinxes, discovered in the same place, it is thought
that we may recognise the portraits of four shepherd
kings, and a colossus discovered at Tel Mokdam is
said to bear the following inscription:&mdash;"The good
god, the star of both worlds, the child of the sun,
Sel Salati, beloved by Sutech, the lord of Hauar.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>"</p>

<p>The six shepherd kings enumerated by Josephus
from the Egyptian History of Manetho reigned,
according to the dates given by the latter, for 260
years, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from the year 2101 <small>B.C.</small>, in which, on
Lepsius's arrangement, the irruption of the shepherds
took place, till the year 1842 <small>B.C.</small> Their successors
must therefore have ruled over Egypt for 251 years
more, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, down to the year 1591 <small>B.C.</small> But in the
time of the later shepherd kings, native princes again
arose in Upper Egypt, although subject to tribute. A
papyrus of the British Museum tells us: "It so happened
that the land of Egypt became the possession
of her enemies, and when this took place there was no
king. And behold Raskenen became king of the
country in the south. The enemy were in possession
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>of the fortress of Aamu (<a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>), and their chief,
Ra Apepi was at Hauar. The whole land paid tribute
to him, and rendered service of all kinds, and brought
to him the produce of Lower Egypt. King Apepi
chose Sutech as his lord, and served no other god, and
built him a temple of firm and lasting structure."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The power of the native princes at Thebes must
have been gradually strengthened till the successors of
Raskenen were in a position to press forward towards
Lower Egypt, and place limits on the sway of the
shepherd kings, and finally to drive them entirely out
of Egypt. Josephus has already told us from Manetho
that the princes of Thebes and the rest of Egypt rose
up against the shepherds, and in consequence a long
and severe struggle took place between them. In
Manetho's list the series of shepherd kings is followed
by Amosis of Thebes (1684-1659 <small>B.C.</small>). Hence we
may assume that it was under this prince that the
kingdom of Thebes got the upper hand, and the
power of the shepherd kings was restricted to the
Eastern Delta.</p>

<p>This conclusion is established by the evidence of
monuments. There Amosis is again mentioned as
king of Upper and Lower Egypt, and two inscriptions
of the twenty-second year of Amosis (1662 <small>B.C.</small>),
in the quarries of Massara, inform us that these
quarries were opened to restore the temples at Memphis
and the temple of Ammon at Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Hence by
this time Amosis had again rescued the old capital,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>Memphis, from the shepherds; that he also forced his
way beyond Memphis, and attacked the shepherds at
Avaris, is proved by the inscription of a tomb at El
Kab, in Upper Egypt. It is the tomb of Aahmes, the
son of Abuna, the chief of the steersmen. The inscription
tells us that, at the time of Amosis, Aahmes, with
his father on the boat, had ministered to "the calf."
He had not yet seen any woman, and wore the clothing
of the young men, when Hauar was attacked. When he
had won a hand, he received the king's commendation,
and the golden necklace in token of his bravery. In
a second and third battle at Hauar he had again won
a hand, and made a prisoner, and he received the
chain for the second and third time.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>From the accounts given in Josephus and the
excerpts of Africanus and Eusebius, Avaris lay eastward
of the Tanitic arm of the Nile, in the province
of Sethroe. Consequently we must look for this
fortified camp of the shepherds on the eastern shore
of the Lake Menzaleh, perhaps on the site of the later
Pelusium. In the lists of kings Amosis is followed by
Amenophis I., then follows Tuthmosis I., then
Tuthmosis II. and III., under the regency of Misphra
(1625-1591 <small>B.C.</small>). From this connection has arisen
the king Misphragmuthosis, who, in Josephus, defeats
the shepherds, drives them out of the rest of Egypt,
and shuts them up in Avaris. Hence it must have
been Tuthmosis III., after the rise of the independent
monarchy (1591-1565), who led the great host of
480,000 men against the shepherds in Avaris, and
failing to enter the place by storm, allowed them to
depart unharmed, whereupon the strangers, to the
number of 240,000, retired into the Syrian desert
(1591 <small>B.C.</small>). Yet the inscriptions do not agree
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>with this account. From the inscription of Aahmes
already quoted, it seems more probable that Amosis
had already taken Avaris, and that Tuthmosis I. had
marched through Syria to Naharina, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to Mesopotamia,
a fact which is confirmed by the inscriptions
of Tuthmosis III., though here also there are accounts
of battles fought by Tuthmosis II. against the Schasu,
or shepherds.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, after a long subjection to
foreign rulers, and weary struggles against them, the
whole land of Egypt was again governed by native
kings. These battles must have invigorated the military
strength of the Egyptians; and the happy result
could not but increase the self-confidence of the new
dynasty to which Egypt owed her liberation. The
mighty impulse thus given carried the kingdom
quickly to the height of its power and greatness.
Tuthmosis III. caused an enumeration to be made
of the conquests which he won from the twenty-second
to the forty-second year of his reign, and the
tribute which he received in this period. In this
enumeration sixteen or seventeen campaigns are mentioned.
In the twenty-third year the king marched
against the Retennu (Syrians). From Kazatu (Gaza)
beyond Taanaka (Taanach) he reached Maketi
(Megiddo). Here, on the twenty-ninth of the month
Pachor he defeated his enemies. The conflict was not
sanguinary. Only eighty-three of the enemy were slain.
The king made 340 prisoners, but took at the same
time 924 chariots and 2,132 horses. Megiddo surrendered,
and Tuthmosis was able to lead back 2,500
prisoners into Egypt. After this 117 cities and places
in Syria surrendered, Kadeschu (Kades), Tevekhu
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>(Tibshath on the Orontes), Maram (Merom), Tamesku
(Damascus), Atara (Ataroth), Hamtu (perhaps Hamath),
Kaanu (Kanah), Masaar (Misheal), Astartu
(Astaroth Karnaim), Hutar (Hazor), Kennarut (Kinneroth),
Aksap (Achshaph), Bar Semas (Beth Shemesh),
Atuma (Adamah), Ranama (Rimmon), Japu (Joppa),
Harar (Har El), Rabbau (Rabbah), Baratu (Berothai,
Berytus), Sarta, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Thus the coast of Syria and the
mountain district as far as Damascus and Hamath
on the Orontes would have become subject to the
Pharaohs. This subjection, however, does not seem
to have gone beyond payment of tribute. The following
campaigns of the king were again for the most
part directed against the Retennu; a battle was fought
at Aratu (Aradus). The sums which Tuthmosis
received in tribute from the Cheta (Hittites) are enumerated.
Afterwards the king made repeated expeditions
against Naharina (Arem Naharaim), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> against
the land of the two rivers, Mesopotamia, and here
also he levied tribute. Then the tribute is given in
the list, which the king received from the Punt (the
Arabians). That Lower Nubia, as far as the old
boundary at Semne, was subject to Tuthmosis III. is
beyond a doubt. An inscription found at Ellesieh in
Nubia informs us that Nahi, the governor of Nubia,
has sent the tribute of the lands of the south to the
king in gold, ebony, and ivory,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and the list quoted
mentions 115 tribes or places subdued by Tuthmosis in
the south of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Of Amenophis II., the successor
of Tuthmosis III. (1565-1555 <small>B.C.</small>), inscriptions
at Amada in Nubia declare that he fought against
the Retennu (Syrians), and slew seven kings, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>that in the south he forced his way as far as Napata,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> up the Nile as far as Mount Barkal.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>His successor, Tuthmosis IV., appears on monuments
of the island Konosso, near Phil&aelig;, as victorious
over the negroes.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> And after him Amenophis III.
(1524-1488 <small>B.C.</small>) again directed his arms in his first
campaign against the negroes; a memorial stone at
Semne tells us that he traversed Abha, the land of the
negroes. That the power of Amenophis III. extended
to the south far beyond Semne is proved by the ruins
of a temple which he built at Soleb on the Nile, "to
his image living upon earth," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the copy or manifestation
of his divine nature, his own divinity,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and
inscriptions on certain scarab&aelig;i assure us that
Amenophis ruled from Naharina, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Mesopotamia, to
the land of Karu in the south.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Thebes was the point from which the liberation of
the land began. Here the new dynasty who had
restored the kingdom, driven out the enemy, and
carried the arms of Egypt far to the south and east,
took up their lasting abode, and this city became the
brilliant centre of the new kingdom. Here, also, the
new Pharaohs glorified themselves by mighty works, as
the old kings had done in the city of Memphis and
the burial-place adjacent. And along with the warlike
vigour displayed by the people, the art and civilisation
of Egypt, under the series of kings extending from
Amosis to Amenophis III. (1684-1488 <small>B.C.</small>), reached
the highest perfection which the position and character
of the nation permitted.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the Nile, on a terrace near
the modern village of Karnak, the first Sesurtesen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>(2371-2325 <small>B.C.</small>), built a temple of moderate size to
Ammon (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>). To this Tuthmosis I. (1646-1625
<small>B.C.</small>) added a splendid gateway, a lofty gate between
two broad wings, which rise in the form of truncated
pyramids, and behind this gateway he built an
oblong court, encircled by a portico supported on
pillars. Against these pillars leaned karyatids, images
of Osiris, with the hands, in which is the cross with
handles, crossed upon the breast. Of these four
remain still uninjured. Before the entrance of the
gateway he erected two obelisks of red granite, of
which one, sixty-nine feet in height, is still standing.
The inscription runs thus:&mdash;"The mighty Horus, the
friend of truth, the king Tutmes, the mighty sun,
which is given to the world, whom Ammon establishes,
has erected this firm structure in honour of
his father Ammon Ra, the protector of the world, and
has placed two large obelisks before the double gates."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
The queen Misphra (Ramake), who was regent for
Tuthmosis II., and in the early years of Tuthmosis
III. (1625-1591 <small>B.C.</small>), erected in the oblong court of
Tuthmosis I. the two second largest obelisks known.
Of these also one is still uninjured, and stands
ninety feet high, the other has fallen, and lies on the
ground. The inscription tells us that the queen whom
Ammon himself had placed on the throne and chosen
as the protectress of Egypt, had resolved in her heart
to erect two great obelisks, the tops of which should
reach to heaven, in honour of the god Ammon and in
remembrance of her father Tuthmosis I., in order that
her name might continue in the temple of Ammon for
ever and ever. Each obelisk was to be of a single
stone of red granite. Her holiness had commenced
the work in her fifteenth year, and completed it in her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>sixteenth, seven months after the work was commenced
in the mountain quarry.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>To this court Tuthmosis III. added a gateway
towards the south, and surrounded the ancient sanctuary
of Sesurtesen with a circle of huge buildings.
These consisted of two halls, each of twelve pillars, to
the right and left of the entrance, on which abut
chambers, great or small as the walls which surround
the old temple allow. On the walls which close these
halls and chambers towards the old building, the king
recorded the events of his reign from the twenty-second
to the forty-second year, from which everything
has already been given which up to this time
can be regarded as certain. The two largest obelisks
also, of which the largest is now standing in Rome
before the Lateran, and the other is destroyed, were
erected by Tuthmosis III., and placed, as it would
seem, before the entrance into the old temple of
Sesurtesen. The obelisk now at Constantinople is
also a work of this prince. The inscription says
that Tuthmosis III. "extended his dominion from
Mount Apta (in the south) to the uttermost habitations
of Mesopotamia."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> On the east side of the
enlarged temple of Sesurtesen, he built a splendid hall,
the roof of which is supported by fifty-six pillars.
Besides this he built additions to the temple of Ra
at Heliopolis, restored the temple at Dendera,
apparently after a plan sketched on a goatskin,
which, belonging to the time of Chufu (<a href="#Page_94">p. 94</a>) was rediscovered
under king Phiops (<a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>),<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and finally he
erected shrines to the sun-god Mentu at Hermonthis,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>near Thebes, the god Sebek at Ombos, Chnum at
Letopolis (Esneh), and on the island of Elephantine.
In Nubia he erected temples at Pselchis, Korte, Amada,
and Semne. The temple at Semne he consecrated to
Chnum and Sesurtesen III., who extended the borders
of Egypt to this point (<a href="#Page_105">p. 105</a>), in order that "the king
might live again in this memorial."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Before the great sphinx, near the second pyramid,
Tuthmosis IV. erected the memorial stone already
mentioned (<a href="#Page_94">p. 94</a>); it represents the king worshipping
the sphinx. In the inscription the sphinx addresses the
king, and says, "I, thy father Harmachu, give thee the
dominion, the world in all its length and breadth, rich
tribute from all nations, and a long life of many years."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>The buildings of Amenophis III. are not inferior to
those of Tuthmosis III. in extent or magnificence.
Half an hour southward of the gateways, court, and
porticoes of the temple at Karnak, close on the right
bank of the Nile, at the modern village of Luxor,
Amenophis built a second temple to Ammon, the god
of Thebes. In a court surrounded by colonnades,
the "court of sacrifice" joined the antechamber of
the temple, or outer temple, then came the temple
with the Holy of Holies, built in the form invariably
used in Egypt after the restoration.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Only the
spacious antechamber, a hall with a roof supported on
pillars and lighted by windows in the wall, or by the
spaces between the front pillars, could be entered by
laymen. The inner temple, reserved for the priests, to
which a second gate led from the antechamber, was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>smaller hall of the same kind, which received only a
moderate light through openings made high up in the
side walls. From this half-darkened room the Holy of
Holies was again separated by a court, and the
entrance was through a door. Two other doors led
by means of a passage running round the Holy of
Holies into the chamber surrounding it. The Holy of
Holies, together with the chambers abutting upon it,
was surrounded by a high wall and formed a separate
temple of small dimensions. The masonry is heavy,
and narrows toward the top. Here in the gloom
dwelt the hidden spirit of the god.  The heavy,
solemn, mysterious character of the Egyptian temple
naturally makes itself most strongly felt in these spaces
or rooms. On the inner walls of the temple the
sacrifices and worship rendered by the king are represented,
on the outer walls we see his achievements
in war. What still remains of the building of Amenophis&mdash;and
it was subsequently enlarged&mdash;allows us
only to conjecture upon the original plan. Yet about
200 pillars and shafts still rise out of the ruins. The
reliefs on the outer walls of the temple, and in the
chambers round the Holy of Holies, are in the best
state of preservation. On the walls of one of these
chambers we see the scribe of heaven, Thoth, announcing
to Mutemua, the mother of Amenophis, the birth
of her son.  Then the ram-god and the goddess
Hathor lead the queen into the lying-in chamber;
another goddess supports the queen during the birth.
Then four heavenly spirits, the two spirits of the
south and the two spirits of the north, carry Amenophis,
already grown into a youth, to a throne in the
presence of Ammon Ra, who anoints him king.
Then the gods promise gifts, honour, and power to
the new king. They declare that the Retennu, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>"nine nations," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the nations bordering on Egypt,
and all people, shall be subject to him.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Far fewer&mdash;not more than a great heap of ruins
with a few pillars and memorial stones&mdash;are the remains
of a second great work of Amenophis III.,
which he built opposite the temple of Karnak on the
west bank of the Nile not far from the modern village
of Medinet Habu. We learn from Pliny that it was
a temple of Serapis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Osarhapi, Osiris-Apis.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
We have already mentioned the shrine of the same
goddess, which was situated among the tombs near
Memphis (<a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>), and we know that in the view of
the Egyptians the west belonged to the setting sun,
the sun of the under world. The statement of Pliny
is also confirmed by two memorial stones among the
ruins, from which we gather that Osiris and Ammon
Ra were the lords of the temple; and it is not
strange that the tutelary god of Thebes should be
associated with Osiris. Before the entrance to this
sanctuary Amenophis caused two statues to be erected,
which still rise like steep cliffs above the flat level
of the bank by the side of a palm forest. They are
two seated figures, and the inscriptions tell us that
both represent Amenophis. The king is in a quiet
attitude, the hands rest on the knees. The front parts
of the throne are formed by statues of the mother and
wife of Amenophis, which reach up to the knees of
the king. The statues were chiselled out of a single
block, as also the bases. The height of the whole is
towards sixty feet.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>The power to which Tuthmosis III. and Amenophis
III. exalted Egypt appears to have declined under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>their successors, or at least it did not advance. The
monuments prove to us that Amenophis IV. (1488-1476
<small>B.C.</small>) began certain religious innovations. He
paid excessive or exclusive reverence to the sun-god,
and attempted to found a new capital in the neighbourhood
of the modern Amarna, in Central Egypt,
which was no doubt intended to be the centre of the
new cult. If, at the same time, as the monuments
show, he was able, like his predecessor, to build at
Soleb, in Dongola, it follows that the supremacy of
Egypt was maintained, at any rate in the south.</p>

as the statue of Memnon. The ruins of this temple, and other buildings
on the west bank of the Nile, were called by them "Memnoneia."&mdash;Diod.
1, 47; Strabo, pp. 813, 816. The name is strictly limited to the temples
and palaces on the west bank. Yet even the fortress of Susa is called
"the Memnonia."&mdash;Herod. 5, 53, 7, 151; Strabo, p. 728; Diod. 2, 22;
Paus. 10, 31. The name as applied to the Egyptian monuments may be a
corruption of Amenophis, so that the name of the buildings of Amenophis
has given the analogy for other similar structures. Still, it is more probable
that the connection of these buildings with the divinity of the
under world, and the death of Osiris, to which the death of Memnon was
compared, is at the root of this nomenclature of the Greeks. The story
of the Ethiopian Memnon, the son of the Morning, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the East, who
came to aid the Trojans and found an early death before Troy, is known
to the Odyssey (11, 522, 4, 187), the Homeric hymns ("In Ven." 219-239)
and the Theogony (l. 984), and was treated in detail by Arktinus of
Miletus about 750 <small>B.C.</small> In Homer's view the Ethiopians dwell in the far
East, at the rising of the sun, beyond the Amazons, whose abode was on
the Thermodon. Hence the ancient Susa, far in the East, the subsequent
capital of the Ach&aelig;menids, might have been the dwelling of the
son of the East. When it was known that the Ethiopians inhabited the
Upper Nile, and the name Memnon was found in Egypt, the Greeks, after
the time of Herodotus, began to search for the Homeric Ethiopians and
Memnon, in and above Egypt. That the name is given to the northern
colossus only is due to the following reasons. In the year 27 <small>B.C.</small> an
earthquake broke this northern colossus and threw the upper parts to the
ground. Then the pedestal and trunk occasionally gave forth a metallic
sound at sunrise.&mdash;Tac. "Annal." 2, 61. This, in the poetic minds of the
Greeks, was the greeting of the son to his divine mother, the Morning,
while she in her sorrow for the early death of her son moistened the statue
every morning with tears of dew. Greek inscriptions on the pedestal from
the time of Nero give the names of witnesses who had heard the sound.
Pausanias, who was of this date, tells us, <i>loc. cit.</i>&mdash;"At Thebes, in Egypt,
is the sounding statue of a seated man, whom most authorities call
Memnon, and say that he forced his way from Ethiopia to Egypt and
Susa. The inhabitants of Thebes, however, deny that it is Memnon. They
regard it as the statue of Phamenoph, a native Egyptian." Ph-Amenoph
is Amenophis with the Egyptian article. The sounding statue was long
regarded as a fable, until the <i>savans</i> of the French expedition, in the early
morning, when the hot sunbeams followed on the cool of the night, as is
usual in the climate of Africa, perceived in the great Egyptian buildings
a small whispering, or singing tone, which must be due to those physical
influences. This phenomenon may have been especially striking in the mutilated
statue of Amenophis. In the time of Septimius Severus, when the
colossus was restored&mdash;the upper parts are now composed of four pieces&mdash;the
inscriptions and the marvel came to an end. The new weight placed
upon the pedestal appears to have checked the vibrations. At present no
sound is heard.&mdash;Letronne, "La Statue vocal de Memnon."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE HOUSE OF RAMSES.</h3>


<p>The Greeks inform us that Sesostris, or Sesosis, was
the greatest warrior among the kings of Egypt. Herodotus
was told by the priests that he was the first who
set out with ships of war from the Arabian Gulf, and
reduced the dwellers by the Red Sea, until he was
checked by waters which were too shallow for navigation.
On his return from this expedition, Sesostris,
as the priests said, gathered together a great army,
invaded the continent, and reduced every nation in
his path. In the conquered lands he set up pillars,
on which were inscribed his name and country, and
that he had reduced the nation by his power.
Wherever he found but little resistance he also caused
female emblems to be engraved on the pillars.
"So he passed from Asia into Europe, and reduced
the Scythians and Thracians. Beyond these the
Egyptian army did not, in my opinion, pass; for in
the country of the Thracians the pillars of Sesostris
are found, but not farther. The greater number of
these pillars are no longer in existence; yet in Syrian
Palestine I have myself seen them with the inscriptions
and emblems. In Ionia also there are two
images of this king hewn in the rock, one on the way
from Ephesus to Phoc&aelig;a, the other on the way from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Sardis to Smyrna. At both places there is the figure
of a man, 4&frac12; cubits high, with a spear in the right hand
and a bow in the left, armed partly as an Egyptian
and partly as an Ethiopian. Across the breast, from
one shoulder to the other, run Egyptian sacred
letters, saying: 'I have conquered this land with
my arms.' Who he is and from whence he comes,
Sesostris does not tell us here, but on the other pillars.
When Sesostris returned, he brought with him many
prisoners from the tribes, and his brother, to whom
Sesostris had entrusted Egypt, gave him a hospitable
reception at Pelusium. But round the house in which
Sesostris was with his wife and children he caused
wood to be heaped, and set on fire. Then the queen
cried out to Sesostris to take two of her six sons,
throw them on the burning wood, and pass over their
bodies as over a bridge. This was done. The two
sons were burnt, but the others with their father
escaped. After taking revenge on his brother,
Sesostris employed the masses of prisoners in drawing
enormous stones to the temple of Heph&aelig;stus, and in
digging all the canals which now intersect Egypt.
By these the land, hitherto an open field for chariots
and horses, was made less accessible. The king's
object in making them was that the cities which were
not on the river should have more water at the time
when the floods were not out. Then Sesostris is
said to have divided the arable land of Egypt into
equal rectangular portions, and to have allotted to
every man an equal portion. And if the inundation
washed away any part of this allotment, the king
returned the owner a corresponding part of his tax.
Sesostris was the only king of Egypt who also ruled
over Ethiopia. As a memorial of his reign, he left
six large statues before the temple of Heph&aelig;stus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>&mdash;images
of himself, his wife, and his four sons; the
two first are thirty, the four last twenty cubits high.
Long after, when Darius wished to place his own
statue in front of these, the priest of Heph&aelig;stus forbade
him, because Darius had not achieved such
mighty deeds as Sesostris. He had reduced the
Scythians, whom Darius had failed to reduce. This
indignity, they say, Darius pardoned."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Diodorus assures us that Sesostris had surpassed the
greatest and most glorious deeds of his predecessors.
"But inasmuch as not only the Greek writers are far
from agreeing in their accounts of this king, but even
the Egyptian priests, and those who sing of his deeds
are at variance, we shall attempt to give the most
probable account and that which is most in agreement
with the monuments still existing in Egypt." When
Sesosis was born, his father gathered together all the
boys born on the same day, more than 1700 in number,
and caused them to be brought up in the same
manner as his own son, in the impression that they
would thus become his most loyal and bravest comrades
in battle. With these companions he first
despatched him against the Arabs, and Sesosis subjugated
the whole country of the Arabs, which no one
had ever subjugated before. In the next place, his
father sent him against the tribes in the west, and
Sesosis, although still quite young, subjugated a great
part of Libya. On the death of his father, Sesosis,
relying on the results of previous campaigns, formed
the resolution of subjugating the whole earth. Having
gained the good will of the Egyptians by gentleness,
remission of punishments, and presents, he gathered
together a great army of the mightiest men, an army of
600,000 infantry, 24,000 cavalry, and 27,000 chariots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
The various divisions of this great host he placed
under the command of those who had been educated
with him, to whom at the same time he allotted the
most fruitful lands in Egypt. With this host Sesosis
first reduced the Ethiopians, who dwelt in the south,
and imposed upon them a tribute of gold, ebony, and
ivory. Then he sent a fleet of four hundred ships into
the Red Sea&mdash;he was the first Egyptian to build ships
of war&mdash;and by means of these he subjugated to his
dominion all the islands and sea-coasts, as far as
India. Meanwhile he marched out in person with
his army, and reduced the whole of Asia. He
crossed the Ganges and passed through India to the
ocean. Then he subjugated the nations of Scythia as
far as the Tanais, which divides Europe and Asia. In
the same manner he reduced the rest of Asia, and
then passed into Europe. But in Thrace he was in
great danger of losing his army through want of food
and the severity of the climate. So he put an end to
the campaign in Thrace, after erecting pillars at many
places in the countries he had subjugated. On these
was engraved, in the character which the Egyptians
called sacred, the following inscription:&mdash;"This land
Sesosis, the king of kings and lord of lords, conquered
with his arms." At some places also he set up his
own statue in stone, with a bow and lance, four cubits
and four hands high, for this was his own height.
After completing these campaigns in nine years,
Sesosis returned with his prisoners and untold spoil.
When at Pelusium, his brother formed a plan for
his destruction. He invited Sesosis to a banquet, and
in the night, when all were asleep after their wine, he
heaped up reeds round the king's tent and set them
on fire. When the flames suddenly sprang up, the
retinue, heavy with wine, could render little service,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
but Sesosis lifted up his hands and besought the
gods to save his wife and children, and with them he
happily escaped from the flames. In gratitude for
this rescue he honoured the gods with dedicatory
statues, more especially the god Heph&aelig;stus, as it was
by him that he was saved. In his temple at Memphis
he placed statues of himself and his wife, monoliths of
thirty cubits high, and also statues of his four sons,
twenty cubits in height. The princes whom he placed
over the conquered nations, or allowed to retain their
thrones, came with presents to Egypt at the appointed
time. Sesosis received them with honour and distinction.
But whenever he went into a temple or a city
he caused his horses to be unyoked from his chariot,
and in their place the princes and rulers were yoked
four abreast, in order to show to all that he was the
mightiest and had conquered the bravest, so that no
one was his equal in valour. Having ended his
wars, Sesosis began to erect great works for his own
glory and the security of Egypt. In every city he
erected a temple to the divinity chiefly worshipped
there. On these works no Egyptian was employed;
they were entirely completed by his prisoners. Moreover,
for the cities which lay too low Sesosis caused
many large dams to be made, to which he transferred
the cities, so that they were secure from the inundations
of the Nile. From Memphis downwards he
carried a number of canals through the whole land,
partly to facilitate commerce, partly to make invasion
more difficult to the enemy. Up to this time the best
part of Egypt was an open field for the movements
of cavalry and chariots; after this it became almost
impassable, owing to the number of canals. In addition
the king built a wall 1,500 stades in length, from
Pelusium to Heliopolis, as a security against inroads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
from Syria and Arabia. To the god held in chief
honour at the city of Thebes he presented a ship of
cedar wood, 280 cubits in length, of which the visible
part was overlaid on the inside with silver and on the
outside with gold, and in his honour he also erected
two obelisks of hard stone, 120 cubits high, on which he
caused to be inscribed the greatness of his power, the
number of the subjugated nations, and the amount of
his income. When he had reigned thirty-three years
his eyesight began to fail, and he voluntarily put an
end to his own life. Many generations after, when
Darius wished to set up his own image in front of
Sesosis, the high priest forbade him in the assembly
of priests, and explained that Darius had not surpassed
the deeds of Sesosis. So far from being
enraged, Darius was pleased at his freedom, and said
that he would henceforth make it his object, should
an equal length of life be given him, to fall below
Sesosis in no respect.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Strabo says: Sesostris appears first of all to have
conquered the land of the Ethiopians and Troglodytes;
on the coast of the Arabian Gulf, between the harbour
of the Protectress and the Elephant-hunt, there stood
on a hill a temple built by Sesostris in honour of Isis.
He succeeded in reaching the land of cinnamon, where
pillars and inscriptions are shown as monuments of his
campaign. Then he crossed over to Arabia, and it is
said that in the narrow part of Ethiopia towards Arabia,
on the promontory of Dir&ecirc;, there was a pillar giving an
account of his crossing. From Arabia he went on to
invade the whole of Asia, and even forced his way
into Europe. In many places ramparts and temples
of the Egyptian style are shown as the work of
Sesostris. In Egypt he undertook the construction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
a canal from the Nile into the Arabian Gulf and
the Red Sea.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>When Germanicus, the son of Drusus, travelled in
Egypt, he saw large remains of ancient Thebes. On
the mighty walls, so Tacitus continues, the Egyptian
inscriptions still remained, telling of their former magnificence.
One of the older priests was bidden to
translate the Egyptian inscriptions, and he informed
them that once there had been 700,000 men of military
age in the kingdom, and with this army Ramses had
subjugated Libya and Ethiopia, the Medes, Persians,
Bactrians, and Scythians, and in addition to these
had ruled over the lands from the Bithynian to the
Lycian Seas, which are inhabited by the Syrians, the
Armenians, and their neighbours, the Cappadocians.
The amount of tribute also imposed upon the nations
was read, the weight of silver and gold, the number
of weapons and horses, the presents of ivory and
frankincense for the temples, and how much each
nation had to contribute in corn and goods&mdash;an
amount no less than that which is now imposed by
the power of the Parthians or the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Josephus, on the authority of Manetho's Egyptian
History, tells us that Sethosis, who was called Ramesses,
possessed a great force in cavalry and ships. After
leaving his brother Armais as governor of Egypt, and
placing the royal power in his hands,&mdash;with the restrictions
that he was not to wear the crown, or do
any injury to the queen-mother and her children, or
approach the king's concubines,&mdash;he marched against
Cyprus and the Phenicians, and afterwards against
the Assyrians and the Medes, and subjugated them all,
some by his arms, others by the fear of his great
power. Fired with ambition by these successes, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
pressed boldly onward to reduce the cities and lands
of the east. Thus his absence was prolonged, and his
brother Armais, without the least shame, disregarded
all the restrictions laid upon him. He violated the
queen, lay with the concubines of the king, allowed
himself to be persuaded by his friends into wearing
the crown, and rebelled against his brother. But the
person who was in authority over the sanctuaries of
Egypt wrote to the king and disclosed all that his
brother had done against him. Sethosis at once turned
back to Pelusium, and established himself again in
possession of the dominion which belonged to him.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Thus, according to the accounts of Tacitus and
Josephus, the warrior whom Herodotus, Diodorus, and
Strabo call Sesostris or Sesosis, was known to the
Egyptians as Ramses, Ramesses, or Sethosis. Let us
now inquire whether the monuments present us with
princes and achievements which confirm the narratives
of the Greeks, the account of Manetho, and the evidence
of Tacitus. According to these it may be assumed
that Horus (Hor, 1455-1443 <small>B.C.</small>) whom the sculptures
of a temple hewn in the rock in the valley of the
Nile at Selseleh represent as a conqueror over the
negroes,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> was succeeded by Ramses I. (1443-1439 <small>B.C.</small>)
who was followed by Sethos I. (1439-1388 <small>B.C.</small>). Of
him we are told in the inscriptions on the outer wall
of the great colonnade which he erected at Karnak
(<a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>) that in the first year of his reign he had
attacked the Schasu, from the fortress of Tar as far
as Kanana;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> his holiness had startled them like a
lion, and made a great slaughter. On a mountain
fortress to which the defeated enemy fled is read,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"Fortress of the land of Kanana (Canaan)." After
this there were expeditions against the Schasu, and
the tribute which they paid to Sethos is mentioned.
The Schasu are the nomad tribes in the desert between
Egypt and Canaan, which had previously conquered
and ruled over Egypt. The inscriptions also remark
that Sethos had twice desolated the land of Cheta
with fire, and had taken Kadeshu (Kades).<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The
Cheta are the Chittim, or Hittites, who possessed the
south of Canaan. Then the sculptures represent the
victory of the king over the Retennu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> over the
tribes of Syria, and inscriptions celebrate the victories
which Sethos had gained over the "nine nations,"<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> over all the nations bordering on Egypt. On the
Upper Nile also Sethos had fought and established his
dominion, as is proved by the ruins of a temple on Mount
Sese in Dongola above the buildings of Amenophis II.
and III. at Soleb.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The representations of the achievements
of Sethos at Karnak are brought to a close by
the victorious return of the king with "innumerable"
prisoners and rich booty, and by two enormous figures
of the king, in each of which he is holding nine
prisoners. The list of the conquered nations first
mentions the tribes of Cush, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the south; then
follow the Schasu, the Cheta, and Naharina (the inhabitants
of Mesopotamia), and last of all the "Punt,"
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the tribes of Arabia. These names are followed
by the observation;&mdash;"This is the list of the nations
of the south and the north, which his holiness has
subdued: the number of prisoners conveyed into
the temple of Ammon Ra cannot be given."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> From
these monuments we gather that Sethos carried on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
number of successful campaigns which begin with
battles against the nomad tribes on the eastern borders
of Egypt, then extend to the south and north of
Syria, and finally to Mesopotamia, while in the other
direction he reduced the tribes of Arabia, and carried
the sway of Egypt beyond Dongola, farther to the
south than before.</p>

<p>Sethos was followed by his son Ramses II. (1388-1322
<small>B.C.</small>).<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> We learnt from Herodotus that Sesostris
had set up pillars in the conquered lands in remembrance
of his campaigns: in Syrian Palestine Herodotus
had himself seen such pillars, and in Ionia there
were two figures of this king hewn in the rock. As a
fact a rock half way between Smyrna and Sardis to
this day presents a relief of an armed warrior. In
style and attitude it is certainly not Egyptian, and
therefore cannot have been the work of a Pharaoh. On
the other hand, the rocks on the Phenician coast which
run into the sea at the mouth of the Nahr-el-Kelb,
near the ancient Berytus, the modern Beyrout, have
Egyptian sculptures upon them. These are three
figures of Ramses II. In one he is carrying an enemy
into the presence of Ammon. In the two others he
is striking down an enemy before the gods Ptah and
Ra. Though to a great extent destroyed, the inscriptions
still show that the achievements, of which these
sculptures are intended to immortalise the memory,
belonged to the second and fourth year of Ramses II.
His arms had therefore reached the coast of Phenicia,
northward of Tyre and Sidon, and he maintained his

memorial of his victory. In the ruins of a temple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
built or restored by Ramses at Tanis (San), we find
an inscription which ascribes to him the subjugation
of the land of Kaft, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Phenicia, of Nebinai,
which is explained to be Cyprus, and lastly of the
Upper Retennu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of eastern Syria.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Inscriptions on
the building of Ramses II. at Karnak, near Medinet
Habu (the so-called Ramesseum), and in his rock
temple at Abu Simbel in Nubia, inform us that he
again fought in Syria in the fifth year of his reign.
Eighteen nations, tribes, or cities are mentioned which
were opposed to the Egyptians. Here, also, the
Cheta, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Hittites, are first mentioned, then the
Karkisa (perhaps the Girgasites),<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Kadeshu (Kades,
either Kadesh Barnea in the south, or Kadesh in the
north of Canaan), Aratu (Aradus), Chirbu (perhaps
Chelbon, Aleppo), Kirkamisha (Karchemish), and
Naharina (Mesopotamia). At Kadesh Ramses was
victorious and thence he returned to Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In the
eighth year of his reign he was again in Canaan. He
took Maram (Merom), Dapurr (perhaps Debir), in the
land of the Amari (Amorites), and Salam,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and on the
walls of the Ramesseum, as also on a large memorial
stone in the ruins of Karnak, there is a treaty of the
twenty-first year of Ramses II., between "Ramses,
the son of the great prince Sethos the brave, the son
of the great prince Ramses I." and "Chetasar (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
the prince of the Cheta), son of the great prince
Maursar the brave, son of the great prince Sepalulu."
It is concluded "on good terms for eternal peace and
friendship, that this may be a beginning for all eternity
according to the intention of the great king of Egypt."
After reference to former treaties, the great king of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Cheta pledges himself never to invade Egypt to inflict
injury, and a similar promise is made by Ramses. Both
kings are to send back those of their subjects who
wish to take service with the other. Either is to help
the other when attacked by enemies. The treaty is
ratified by oaths on either side; and Sutech (Baal)
appears as the tutelary god of the Cheta.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Such is the information we can gain from monuments
of the achievements of Ramses II. in Syria. His campaigns
in the south appear to have been attended by
more important results. Sculptures in the temple at
Abu Simbel display the king sitting on his chariot, and
leading back as prisoners red figures, which here are
probably Nubians, and negroes with ropes round their
necks: both tribes have no other garments but the
skins of wild animals. In another temple hewn in
the rock of the western bank at Beth-el-Walli, a little
above Syene, we see Ramses II. standing alone upon
his war chariot, rushing with drawn bow on a crowd
of negroes, who are armed with very long bows, but
clothed only with skins. They fall before the horses
of the king. Thus defeated, they fly to their villages,
which lie in a valley shadowed by cocoa-palms, in
the tops of which apes are climbing. Women and
children come forth in distress to meet the fugitives.
The prisoners and the booty are brought before the
king, chieftains in fetters, and negroes carrying
elephants' tusks and ebony; others lead lions, panthers,
antelopes, gazelles, ostriches, and a giraffe, the
animal of Central Africa.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Besides this Ramses II.
founded the furthest monument of Egyptian dominion
up the stream of the Nile, so that he must have
ruled further to the south than his father Sethos.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Beyond Soleb, under the steep spur of Mount Barkal,
400 miles or more above Syene, lie the ruins of a
temple which Ramses built in honour of Ammon.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Symbolical representations of the temple already mentioned
at Abu Simbel on the right and left of the
entrance collect all the victories which Ramses won.
Before the god Ammon, who hands to the king the
scythe of battle, Ramses is brandishing his club upon a
crowd of kneeling enemies, whom he has seized by
the forelock. Among these are three negroes, three
red and beardless men, and four forms which are yellow
and bearded. Ammon speaks thus: "I give thee the
scythe, slay with it; I give thee the south for subjection,
and the north for conquest, and to put to flight
all the tribes of the perverse nations, and to extend the
fabric of thy dominion to the pillars of the sky."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>On this evidence we find that the narratives of the
Greeks of the deeds of Sesostris, with whom tradition
has amalgamated Sethos and Ramses II., and also
Manetho's account of the exploits of Ramses, and
what the priest read about them to Germanicus at
Thebes, are all violent exaggerations. Of the battles in
the north-east and in Asia, we find in the inscriptions
only the battles fought by Sethos against the shepherds,
between Egypt and Syria, against the Schasu, against
the Hittites, against the Retennu, and finally a campaign
to Mesopotamia, or at least battles against
princes of the Euphrates. Of Ramses II. we find that
he forced his way as far as Berytus in Syria, and
fought against Syrian tribes and cities, with whom
Karchemish on the Euphrates, and other princes of the
Euphrates (Naharina) are said to have been united.
Even as early as Tuthmosis I. and III., and Amenophis
III., the inscriptions mention campaigns to Mesopo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>tamia.
They tell us that Tuthmosis III. forced his
way into the interior of Mesopotamia, and enumerate
the regions which he compelled to pay tribute. With
regard to Ramses II. the monuments prove no more
than that he temporarily reduced Syria, including the
Phenician cities and the island of Cyprus, which
was probably already dependent upon them. The
subsequent battles and the treaty of Ramses II. with the
Cheta, prove how slight were the successes so highly
extolled in the inscriptions. If the Hittites were
never reduced to obedience, all the more distant campaigns
into Syria, and all attempts against Mesopotamia
had only a momentary result, and could hardly
have been more than mere raids. In the inscriptions,
every Pharaoh, from Amosis onward, is found fighting
against the same nations, the Schasu, the Cheta, the
Retennu, the Punt, the Cushites, &amp;c., and each time
we are assured that the "eight" or "nine nations,"
"the lands of the north and south," the earth from
one end to the other has been subdued. It is by no
means remarkable that the recollections of the campaigns
of the third Tuthmothis and Amenophis, of the
achievements of Sethos, and of Ramses II. and of
Ramses III., of which we have still to speak, supported
as they were by the flattery and exaggeration of the
inscriptions, should combine in the tradition of the
Egyptians into a monarch who subdued the whole earth,
of whom certain accounts and these, as Diodorus says,
by no means accordant, passed to the Greeks. And
Diodorus observes expressly that these contradictions
were not due to the Greeks, but to the Egyptian
priests and those who sang of the exploits of
Sesostris.</p>

<p>As we have seen, this tradition lays especial weight
on the achievements of Sesostris in Ethiopia, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Red Sea, and in Arabia. Herodotus tells us that the
priests assured him that the king&mdash;at first sailing with
ships of war out of the Arabian Gulf&mdash;had subjugated
the inhabitants of the Red Sea. He was, they said,
the only king who had ruled at once over Egypt and
Ethiopia. In Diodorus we find that he first reduces
the whole of Arabia, which had never before been
conquered, and the greater part of Libya, and the
Ethiopians in the south of Egypt. Afterwards he&mdash;first
of the Egyptians&mdash;built ships of war, and sent
them into the Red Sea, and with these reduced all the
coasts and islands as far as India. In Strabo Sesostris
first marches against Ethiopia, forces his way as far as
the land of Cinnamon, then crosses the Straits of
Bab-el-Mandeb, reduces Arabia, and commences the
digging of a canal from the Nile to the Arabian Gulf.
The monuments confirm the statement that Sethos
fought with the Punt, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Arabs, that he pushed
farther than his predecessors into the territory of the
negroes, and that Ramses II. (in whose reign the
monuments mention governors of Ethiopia)<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> established
a lasting supremacy as far as Mount Barkal.</p>

<p>Thus it is established that the dominion of Egypt
under Ramses II. extended beyond Nubia and Dongola,
and reached the territory of the negroes, while at the
same time the tribes of the Arabian peninsula may
have been to a great extent reduced to pay tribute; and
from this we may draw the conclusion that the attention
of Sethos and Ramses was mainly directed to
these regions. The products which they could obtain
by tribute or by trade with these tribes&mdash;slaves, gold,
ebony, ivory, frankincense, spices, gum&mdash;were of
great value for Egypt, and ships of war were needed
both to keep in submission the tribes which may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
been subjugated on the coasts of Arabia, and to maintain
the trading stations settled on the east coast of
Africa. For the fleet of Ramses Herodotus refers to
the evidence of the priests. Such a fleet is, as a fact,
exhibited on the monuments of Ramses III., and the
tradition of the Hebrews tells us of trading ships
which, about the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, sailed from Elath
out of the Arabian Sea, and reached the mouth of the
Indus, no doubt on routes the Egyptian trade had
already laid down to the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb
and the southern coast of Arabia. In connection with
these efforts, directed towards the establishment of
trade and authority on the Arabian Sea, it seems
intelligible that Sethos and his son Ramses should
have entertained the idea of establishing a water
communication between the Nile and this sea, and
should have actually commenced the work. Remains
of a canal, beginning on the Nile at Bubastis, above
the city, ran through the valley of Tumilat, a depression
of the Arabian hills towards the east, in the
direction of the Lake of Crocodiles and the Bitter
Lakes.  On these remains at Tel-el-Kebir and Abu
Kesheb are the ruins of Egyptian buildings. At the
second place an image of Ramses II. has been found,
worshipping Tum and Ammon. We may assume that
the ruins at Tel-el-Kebir are those of the city of Pithom
(Patumos, <i>pa-tum</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> habitation of Tum), which we
learn from Herodotus lay on this canal, and those at
Abu Kesheb are the ruins of the city of Ramses (<i>pa-rameses</i>),
names preserved to us in the tradition of
the Hebrews, and that Sethos and Ramses II. had
built both these cities.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The Hebrews, whose fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>fathers
had broken off from the Edomites, the settlers
on Mount Seir, which runs from the north-east point
of the Red Sea to the Dead Sea, and pastured their
flocks on the Pelusiac arm of the Nile under Egyptian
protection, have a tradition that it was they who were
compelled to build Pithom and Ramses for the
Pharaoh. The canal remained unfinished; at that
time it apparently reached only to the Lake of Crocodile.
Seven hundred years later Necho carried it
as far as the Bitter Lakes; it was finished by King
Darius and the Ptolemies, who completed what the
Pharaohs were unable to carry out.</p>

<p>The tradition of the mighty deeds of Sesostris in
Asia contradicts itself in the most glaring manner,
inasmuch as it likewise tells us that he dug a number
of canals from Memphis downwards to the sea, in order
to fortify the land and make the approach difficult for
enemies. The eastern side of Egypt also he fortified
against the inroads of Arabians and Syrians, by
building a wall of about 1,500 stades long through
the desert from Pelusium to Heliopolis. And the
inscriptions on the building of Sethos at Karnak are
believed to tell us that this prince had erected "the
double walls against the lands of the impure."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> No
line of fortification was required against the nomads
on the eastern border, if these were sufficiently
held in check by the Egyptian arms, or had been
thoroughly subjugated. This great fortification
which passed beyond the protecting arm of the
Nile from Bubastis in a slanting direction through the
desert, from the sea to Heliopolis, along a line of about
1,500 stades, may very likely have been connected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the making of the canal. The trade on the canal
would be protected against predatory attacks, and the
territory rescued from the desert by its construction,
and the cities adjacent would be protected. The city
which Ramses built on the canal and named by his
own name apparently belonged to those fortifications.
It was a border fortress against the desert and the
attacks of Syrian tribes.</p>

<p>Of Menephta, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> beloved of Ptah (1322-1302 <small>B.C.</small>),
the son and successor of Ramses II., Josephus,
following Manetho, gives us the following account:&mdash;"Like
Horus, who had been king before him,
Menephta desired to see the gods. This wish he confided
to a wise prophet, the son of Papius. The prophet
told him that he would see the gods if he cleared the
whole land of leprous and unclean persons. Then the
king collected out of Egypt all who were diseased in
their bodies, to the number of 80,000, and threw them
into the stone quarries east of the Nile, that they might
labour there along with the other Egyptians condemned
to similar toil. But as among the diseased
persons were certain men of learning and priests who
had been attacked by leprosy, the son of Papius
feared the anger of the gods would descend upon
himself and the king if holy men were forced into
slavish tasks, and he foresaw that others would come
to the aid of these impure persons, and rule over
Egypt for thirteen years. He did not venture to tell
this to the king, but wrote it down, and then put an
end to his own life. Filled with anxiety, when the
lepers had suffered long enough in the stone quarries,
the king gave them Avaris, the city abandoned by
the shepherds, as a refuge and protection. But
according to the old mythology this city belonged to
Typho. When the unclean persons came to Avaris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and were in possession of a centre to support any
disaffection, they chose Osarsiph, one of the priests at
Heliopolis, as their leader, and swore to obey him in
everything. The first law he gave them was to
offer prayer to no god, and to abstain from no animal
held sacred in Egypt, but to sacrifice them all and
eat them, and to hold communion with none but those
who had taken the oath. After giving these and
many other laws, diametrically opposed to the
Egyptian customs, Osarsiph bade them fortify the
city, and arm themselves against Menephta, while he
took counsel with certain priests and infected persons,
and sent an embassy to Jerusalem, to the shepherds
driven out by Tuthmosis. He told them what an
outrage had been done to him and his associates, and
called on them to march against Egypt with the same
intentions as himself. Avaris, the city of their forefathers,
would first open its gates to them and give
freely whatever they needed, and whenever necessary
he would fight at their head and easily subdue the
land for them. Delighted at the message, the
shepherds all set out with eagerness, about 200,000
strong, and were soon in Avaris. When Menephta
heard of their approach, he was seized with alarm, for
he bethought him of the prophecy of the son of
Papius. It is true he gathered together about
300,000 of the flower of the Egyptian army, but
when the enemy met him, he would not join
battle, fearing to fight against the gods. After
taking counsel with his officers, he gave orders for the
sacred animals, which were held in especial honour, to
be brought to him, and bade the priests secure the
images of the gods with the greatest care; and when
he had placed his son Sethos, now five years old, in
security with a friend, he turned back to Memphis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Then he took Apis and the other sacred animals,
which the priests had brought to Memphis, with him,
and retired with his army and the bulk of the
Egyptians to Ethiopia. The king of Ethiopia, who
was under a debt of gratitude to Menephta, received
him and the multitude with him, provided for the
Egyptians, and allotted them cities and villages sufficient
to support them for the thirteen years, and
caused the Ethiopian army to keep watch on the
borders of Egypt. But the men of Jerusalem and the
unclean invaded Egypt, and displayed such impious
rage against the Egyptians, that to those who witnessed
their wickedness their dominion seemed the
worst of all. They were not content with burning
cities and villages, with plundering the sanctuaries,
and destroying the images of the gods, they even
compelled the priests and prophets to sacrifice and
strangle the sacred animals, and then they thrust them
naked out of the temples, and ate the animals if at all
good for food. But in time Menephta returned with
a great host from Ethiopia, and his son Ramses also
with an army. Both attacked the unclean and the
shepherds, and overcame them. Many they slew, and
the rest they pursued as far as the borders of Syria.
It is said that the priest who gave them their constitution
and laws, a native of Heliopolis, and called
Osarsiph, from Osiris, the god worshipped there,
changed his name from Osarsiph to Moses."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>From the tradition of the Hebrews we learn that
their ancestors, after pasturing their flocks for a long
time, under Egyptian protection, on the Pelusiac arm
of the Nile, in the land of Goshen, became weary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the task-work imposed upon them, and set forth out
of Egypt, in order to feed their flocks in freedom in
the peninsula of Sinai, to the east of the Dead Sea.
The oppression of these shepherds by Egypt may, of
course, be connected with the fortification of the border
towards Syria, the construction of the canal, and the
erection of the cities for trade, and the border fortresses
on this canal. Accordingly there seems no reason
to contest the tradition of the Egyptians that the
exodus of the Hebrews took place under Menephta.
That the Egyptian tradition regards these Hebrews as
leprous and unclean Egyptians is of no importance.
The cession of Avaris and invitation of the Hyksos is
mere imagination, arising from the somewhat analogous
event of former times. The most improbable
fact is the voluntary departure of Menephta to the
allied king of the Ethiopians, and the abandonment
of Egypt without a struggle to her fiercest foe. Under
Ramses II., as we have seen, Ethiopia, as far as
Mount Barkal, became an Egyptian province. Far
more credible is the tradition of the Hebrews that the
army of the Pharaoh met with a heavy reverse in the
attempt to check the exodus of the Hebrews, and
their union with the hostile tribes of the desert. It
is possible that, in consequence of this disaster, a king
was set up in opposition to Menephta, and that
Menephta retired before him to Ethiopia, from
whence he afterwards recovered Egypt. In the
excerpt of Eusebius we find, after the name
Menephta, a king Amenemes, and on the monuments
Amenemessu, whose shields, though chiselled
out, can still be recognised.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Of all these things the monuments of Menephta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
know nothing. On the contrary, a long inscription in
the small court, on the southern wall of the temple at
Karnak, tells us of a victory which Menephta had
obtained over the Libyan tribes. These are the Lubu
(Libyans), Maschawascha (who may be explained as
the Maxyans, a tribe which, as Herodotus tells us,
dwelt near Lake Triton, on the north coast of Africa),
the Kesak, and from the "regions on the sea," the
Tuirscha, Sakalascha, Schardaina, Akaiwascha, and
Leku. They had crossed the western border and
forced their way, not into the land only, but down to
the river, and had pitched their camp in the territory
of the city Paali. The king was obliged to protect
the city of Tum and the sanctuary of Ptah Tatamen
(perhaps Memphis). On the first of Epiphi&mdash;the year
of the reign of Menephta was not given, or at any rate
is not found now&mdash;a battle took place. Of the Lubu
6,359 were slain; of hands belonging to the Sakalascha
250 were counted, and 790 belonging to the Tuirscha.
Fourteen pairs of horses were taken, belonging to the
chief of the Leku and his sons, and 9,111 swords of
the Maschawascha.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Menephta was succeeded by Sethos II. and
Menephta II. Then followed Ramses III. (1269-1244
<i><small>B.C.</small></i>). The warlike exploits which this king
has commemorated on his temple at Medinet Habu
appear from the inscriptions to have been hardly
inferior to those of Sethos I. and Ramses II. In the
reliefs of this temple is seen an Egyptian fleet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the engagement with the ships of the enemy. On a
picture on a wall are collected all the campaigns of
the king; the chiefs of the conquered tribes are represented
by fourteen figures, and the accompanying
hieroglyphics give us the names of their tribes. Two
of these names are destroyed, and a third is illegible.
The first figure is the chief of the "evil land of
Cush." Two of the figures are negroes, and their
tribes are mentioned. Then follow the lord "of the
hostile Schasu," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the shepherds of the Syrian border,
the "evil chief of the Cheta," against whom the
inscription observes that he was taken alive, the "evil
chief of the Amari" (Amorites), the sovereign of the
Lubu (Libyans), the sovereign of the Maschawascha,
the coast-land Tuirscha, the coast-land Schardaina,
and the "lord of the hostile Zakkarj."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The first
Menephta, as we have seen, had been compelled to
fight against the Lubu, Maschawascha, Tuirscha, and
Schardaina. The remaining figures prove that
Ramses III. carried on war on the Upper Nile against
the Nubians and Negro tribes, and in the north-east he
had to contend with the Schasu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the descendants
of the Hyksos, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the old
enemies against whom his forefathers took the field.
To these the Pulista, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Philistines, who are here
mentioned for the first time, are added in a list of the
nations reduced by the king in the eighth and ninth
years of his reign, inscribed on the right wing of the
gateway which leads into the second court of the
temple. In the second court four pictures represent
the achievements of the king in the fifth year of his
reign against the Lubu (Libyans), and ten pictures on
the outer side of the north wall give the achievements
of the eighth and ninth years. First there is a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
slaughter of the Temhu, apparently the general name
under which the Egyptians comprehended the Libyan
tribes. The enumeration of hands and members gives
a total of 12,535 for each, and the scribe on the picture
is taking this down. On the eighth picture the
Egyptian ships, with beaks ending in lions' heads, and
mastheads manned by archers, are man&#339;uvring with
sails and oars to thrust the enemy's ships upon the
shore, on which is drawn up the Egyptian army with
arrows also directed against the hostile ships. The
inscriptions tell us that these are the ships of the
Zakkarj. At a fortress over which is written Magadil
(Migdol?) the captive Zakkarj are brought before the
king. This is on the ninth picture; on the tenth the
king celebrates his return to Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Ramses III. was followed by eleven kings of the
same name (1244-1091 <i><small>B.C.</small></i>). But the days of warlike
expeditions were over. The inscriptions which
have come down to us from these rulers only prove
that their sovereignty was maintained over Nubia, and
tell us of certain buildings which these princes also
erected at Memphis.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Of Ramses XII. a memorial
stone found in the temple of the moon-god Chunsu at
Karnak&mdash;a deity to whom the house of Ramses paid
especial honour&mdash;informs us that he elevated the
daughter of the lord of the land of Buchten (or
Bachtan) to be Queen of Egypt. When afterwards
another daughter of the chief fell ill, he besought the
king of Egypt for a wise man to cure her. The
priest, whom Ramses sent, found the king's daughter
possessed by a spirit, but he was too weak to contend
with it. Then the chief of Buchten besought Ramses
to send him a god to overcome the spirit.  And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Ramses sent the image of the god Chunsu from the
temple at Thebes in a large boat, accompanied by five
small boats and a chariot. The spirit gave way
before the god, and the chieftain was in great joy, and
refused to allow the god to return to Egypt, until in
a dream he saw a golden hawk, which spread out its
wings to fly to Egypt. On awaking he found himself
seized by an illness. So he allowed the god to return
to Egypt after he had kept him three years and nine
months, and gave him many rich presents for the
journey.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE MONUMENTS OF THE HOUSE OF RAMSES.</h3>


<p>More than ten centuries seem to have elapsed from
the founding of the kingdom of Memphis before
Egypt ventured beyond her natural borders. The
peninsula of Sinai, the shores of the Red Sea opposite
Thebes, and Semne in Nubia were the extreme
limits in the times of the kings who built the pyramids,
of the Sesurtesen and Amenemha. The impulse
given by the successful war of liberation
carried Egypt beyond these boundaries. When
Amosis and Tuthmosis III. had restored the kingdom,
it reached the summit of its greatness and splendour
under the latter and Amenophis III., Sethos I., and
Ramses II., while Ramses III. strengthened anew
and maintained the position which his great forefathers
had obtained for Egypt. Four centuries of
glory and victory had now passed over Egypt (1650-1250),
the victorious arms of the Pharaohs had
been carried to Nubia and Dongola, to the Negroes,
to Libya and Syria in repeated campaigns; more
than once the Euphrates had seen the Egyptian
armies. In these centuries Egypt was the first kingdom
in the ancient world, not in civilisation merely,
or in art, but in military power, though her lasting
acquisitions were limited to the Upper Nile. For yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
another century and a half the successors of Ramses
III. could enjoy undisturbed the fruits of the exertions
of their ancestors.</p>

<p>As the new kingdom surpassed the old in power, so
did the new capital Thebes eclipse the older Memphis.
None of these princes neglected to offer his booty to
Ammon of Thebes; from the time of Tuthmosis I. to
Ramses III. no king omitted to adorn Thebes with
new buildings. The city must have presented a most
marvellous appearance when the works of the Tuthmosis
and Amenophis, of Sethos, of Ramses II. and
III. stood erect and rose up from the earth solid and
massive as rocks on either bank of the Nile, while the
multitude of obelisks and colossi towered up like
a forest of stone. Fancy might imagine that she
looked upon a city built by giants. The houses
of the people also, though built of brick only, as
Diodorus tells us, were three or four stories high.
Diodorus fixes the circuit of the city at more than
fifteen miles; for us it is still marked by the remains
of the temples of Karnak, Luxor, Gurnah, and
Medinet Habu.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>We have spoken above of the buildings erected by
Tuthmosis I. and III. at Karnak, and Amenophis III.
at Luxor and Medinet Habu. It was Sethos I. who
on the west of the oblong court, the gateway, and
obelisks of Tuthmosis I. at Karnak, added a hall on
the most magnificent scale, the entrance to which is
also formed by a gateway. This hall, the most
splendid monument of Egyptian architecture, is 320
feet long, and over 160 feet broad; the roof rests on
134 pillars, which on each side towards the north and
south form seven naves, each of nine pillars. The
central space, supported on either side by six pillars of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
12 feet in diameter and 68 feet in height, rises higher
than the naves at the side. On the external wall of
this hall are displayed the triumphs of Sethos over
the Schasu, the Cheta, and the Retennu; there are
recorded the campaigns already mentioned against the
tribes of Cush, the Punt, and the Naharina. Opposite
Karnak, on the left bank of the Nile, north east
from the colossi of Amenophis III., at the village of
Gurnah, he built a temple to Ammon, and at Abydus
a large sanctuary to Osiris.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>None of the Pharaohs undertook such numerous
works and left behind so many monuments as Ramses
II. He completed the hall of his father at Karnak,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
and extended on a magnificent scale the temple of
Amenophis III. at Luxor, by adding on the north-east
a second court, and adorning the entrance to it by a
lofty gateway. Before this he placed two seated
colossi, statues of himself&mdash;at present, like the lower
parts of all the ruins at Luxor, they are covered to a
considerable height with sand&mdash;and two obelisks of
red granite, of which one still rises in splendour to the
blue sky, and displays the long, sharply-cut rows of
the hieroglyphics in all the brightness of the uninjured
polish. The other is at Paris, in the Place de la Concorde.
On the left bank of the Nile, between the
colossi of Amenophis III. and his father's temple, a
little further to the west, and immediately at the foot
of the Libyan range, he built a large temple. A
massive gateway rises on a slightly elevated terrace,
leading to a rectangular court. This is surrounded by
a double row of pillars supporting the portico, of
which two only are now standing. On this follows a
second court, of which the portico is supported on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
right and left by double pillars, on the front transverse
side by single pilasters, and on the back by
double pilasters, against the first row of which lean
colossal images of Osiris. At the entrance from the
first into the second court, on the left, was the greatest
of all the detached colossi in Egypt, the seated statue
of Ramses, hewn out of a block of red granite from
Syene. Sixty feet in height, this statue once overlooked
both courts; now it lies prostrate on the ground.
The length of the middle finger is four feet. There
was apparently a second colossus on the other side of
the entrance corresponding to this. From the second
court, in which are the remains of two smaller colossi,
three gates of black granite led into a great hall, built
on a higher level. The roof of this, the remains of
which exhibit a blue ground with gold stars, was
supported by sixty pillars in ten rows. Of these rows
four are still standing; the pillars are 35 feet in
height and six feet in diameter. On this great hall
adjoin three smaller ones, on both sides of which lay
chambers, and the roof of one is adorned with a large
astronomical painting. The back part of the building
was formed by vaulted porticoes of brick, and each
brick is stamped with the name-shield of Ramses II.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The inscriptions on the second court and in the hall
tell us, "that the gracious god, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the king, erected
this great structure in honour of his father Ammon-Ra,
the king of the gods: by his own arm he has
erected it, the royal sun, the champion of justice,
established by Ra, the child of the sun, Ramses,
beloved of Ammon, beloved of the goddess Mut." On
the walls of the portico between the first and second
court is represented a great procession to the altar of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Ammon. Two rows of men carry the statues of thirteen
predecessors of Ramses on their shoulders (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>).
Further on the king, with a sickle, is cutting a sheaf of
corn from the field, a priest receives this from the
hand of the king, and offers it to a white bull. Then
the priest bids the four geese belonging to the four
spirits of the quarters of the sky to fly south, north,
east, and west, in order to announce to the gods of
each quarter, "that Horus the son of Osiris, that
king Ramses, established by Ra, has put on the
double crown."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The sculptures of the front side
of the gateway exhibit the king in intercourse with
the gods, and symbolise the divine expressions of
favour towards Ramses. Gods lead him to the
greater gods. The god Tum places him before Mentu
(<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>). Mentu takes the hand of the king, and
says, "Come to the heavenly mansions, to behold thy
father the king of the gods, who will bestow upon
thee length of days, to rule over the world and reign
upon the throne of Horus." Mentu leads the king to
Ammon, over whose figure we read, "Ammon-Ra,
king of the gods, who dwells in Ramses' house at
Thebes, speaks thus: Beloved son of my race, Ramses,
lord of the world, my heart is glad in that I behold
thy good works; thou hast built me this house; I
grant thee a pure life to live upon the throne of Seb"
(<a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>). In the hall Ammon is holding the crook
from his throne towards the king, and says, "I certify
that thy building shall continue as the heavens." The
goddess Bast (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>) lifts her right hand to the head
of the king, and says, "I have prepared for thee the
diadem of the sun, that this helmet should remain
upon thy brow, where I have placed it." On another
sketch in this hall Ammon is giving to Ramses the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
scythe, the whip, and the crook (the symbols of dominion),
and says, "Take the scythe of battle to subdue the
nations without, and to smite off the head of the unclean;
take the whip and the crook to rule over Chemi
(Egypt)." On the exterior of the wings of the gateway
are represented the wars which in the fifth year
of his reign Ramses carried on against the Cheta, and
in the eighth year against Maram, Dapur, and Salam
(<a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a>). In one of the side chambers of the hall
Ramses and his consort, together with the moon-god,
Chunsu, and the goddess Mut, are carried to Ammon
by the priests. The goddess Mut says: "I come to
pay worship to the king of the gods, that he may
secure long years to his son, to king Ramses, who
loves him." Chunsu says: "We come to honour thee,
Ammon, king of the gods; grant to thy son who
loves thee, the king of the world, a safe and pure life."
The king and queen also speak to Ammon; Ramses
says: "I come to my father escorted by the gods
whom he at all times allows in his presence." And
over the queen we read: "Behold what the divine
consort says, the royal mother, the mighty mistress
of the world:&mdash;I come to worship my father Ammon
the king of the gods; my heart is gladdened by
thy favour. O thou who hast established the seat
of thy power in the dwelling of thy son Ramses,
lord of the world, grant to him a safe and pure life,
and let his years be numbered by the periods of the
festivals." Finally, Ramses is represented under an
arbor vit&aelig; (Persea) before the throne of Tum. Tum
and Thoth write the name of the king on leaves of
the arbor vit&aelig;, and Tum says to Ramses: "I write
thy name for a series of days that it may be upon
the divine tree." In another chamber we find the
figures of the children of Ramses; twenty-three sons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and more than thirteen daughters are mentioned in
the inscription.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>This is the structure of which Diodorus gives the
following account, though he had not seen the work
himself. "The entrance to the monument of the king
whom they call Osymandyas&mdash;such is the account in
Diodorus&mdash;was formed by a gateway covered with
sculptures, 200 feet broad, and forty-five cubits in
height; through this you passed into a rectangular
court surrounded by pillars, measuring 400 feet on
each side, but in the place of pillars are statues sixteen
cubits high, each hewn in the antique style out of a
single block. The roof of the portico is two fathoms in
width; it also is built of monoliths painted with stars
upon a blue ground. Behind this court there is a
second gateway similar to the first, but adorned with
still richer sculptures. At the entrance stand three
monolithic statues. The middle one is the seated
image of Osymandyas, the largest in all Egypt, for
the feet are more than seven cubits in length; the two
others, on the right and left, which represent the wife
and daughter of the king, are inferior in height. This
statue is not only remarkable for the size, but also for
the excellence of the art and the nature of the stone.
In spite of the enormous size, a chip or split is not
to be found in it. There, too, is the statue of the
mother of Osymandyas, twenty cubits high, and also a
monolith. Behind this gateway is a second court,
more marvellous even than the first, in which various
sculptures represent the war against the Bactrians.
This nation had revolted from the king, but with
400,000 foot and 20,000 horse he marched out against
them, divided his army into four parts, and put each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
under the command of one of his four sons. On the
first wall we see the king fighting at the head of his
army against a fortress surrounded by a river; a lion
is seen at his side assisting him (as a fact in the
picture of the great battle against the Cheta on the
gateway a lion is found beside the chariot of the king.)
On the second wall the prisoners are brought forward:
they are without their hands and members, in order to
indicate that they fought without spirit. The third
wall contains reliefs of various kinds and sketches
representing the king's sacrifice of bulls, and his
triumphant return. In the middle of the court stands
an altar of marvellous size and workmanship. Before
the fourth wall are two seated colossi 27 cubits high,
and beside these three entrances lead into a colonnade,
of which the sides measure 200 feet. In this
hall are a number of statues of wood representing men
in expectation of the decision of their law-suits, and
looking towards the judges. These, thirty in number,
are engraved on one of the walls; in their midst is
the chief judge, on whose neck hangs a picture of
truth with closed eyes; beside him lie a great quantity
of books.  Then you pass into a space intended for
walking, where are represented many of the most
delicate kinds of food. Here also the image of the
king is engraved, and brightly coloured, showing how
he offered to the god the gold and silver which came
to him year by year from the mines of Egypt, and the
total is written down close by; estimated in silver,
it amounted to 320,000 min&aelig;. Then follows the
sacred library, and after this the images of all the gods
of Egypt, and of the king, who offers to each god the
appropriate gifts, in order as it were to show to Osiris
and his assessors in the under world that the king had
lived a life just towards men and pious towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
gods. On the walls of the library abuts another building,
in which are twenty couches, the images of Zeus
and Hera, and the images of the king. In this chamber
the king appears to be buried. In a circle round this
chamber are yet many other rooms containing very
beautiful pictures of all the animals worshipped in
Egypt. Through these chambers we reach the top of
the sepulchre, a golden circle 365 cubits in circumference,
and one cubit thick. On this circle are
marked divisions for every day in the year, and in
each is noted the rising and setting of the stars,
and the influence which the Egyptian astrologers
attributed to these constellations."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>The temple built by Ramses II. to Ammon, in
Dongola, on Mount Barkal, has been mentioned before
(<a href="#Page_154">p. 154</a>). A memorial stone discovered at Dakkeh
tells us that he caused wells to be dug in Ethiopia.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
In Nubia also, five or six days' journey to the south of
Dakkeh, at Abu Simbel, on the left bank of the Nile,
a small valley with almost perpendicular walls of rock
breaks at right angles the ridge running by the river
side. In these walls of brownish yellow sandstone
two temples have been cut. The northern and larger
is dedicated to Ra by Ramses; the smaller, on the
opposite side, is dedicated by Ramses' wife, Nefruari,
to the goddess Hathor. Before the temple of Hathor
are six colossi, three on either side of the entrance.
In each triad the middle statue represents the queen,
the two others the kings. Before the temple of Ramses
are four seated colossi, with the arms upon the hips,
hewn out of the natural rock. All are statues of
Ramses, and in height are over sixty, or, counting
the thrones, over seventy feet. The breadth across the
shoulders is twenty-five feet; from the elbow to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
tip of the finger measures fifteen feet. Seen from a
distance, these statues are very impressive, owing to
their severe and calm beauty, and the correctness of
the proportions, notwithstanding the enormous scale.
The entrance to the temple lies deep down between the
thrones of the colossi. First we pass into a spacious
portico, of which the roof is supported by eight pillars,
against which lean as many standing colossi about 30
feet high, with arms crossed, the whip and the symbol
of life in their hands. All are images of Osiris. From
this portico, out of which doors open on either hand
into side halls, we arrive through two chambers into
the sanctuary of the goddess, which lies 200 feet deep
in the rock. The whole excavation consists of fourteen
chambers. The sculptures, painted throughout, are
uninjured still, and of the most brilliant colours. The
most striking pictures among them have been mentioned
above (pp. <a href="#Page_153">153</a>, <a href="#Page_154">154</a>). Below Abu Simbel, at Derr Sebua
and Gerf Hussein, on the Nile, Ramses II. built
temples to Ra, Ammon, and Ptah. Here, as at Abu
Simbel, new cities rose round the temples.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Further
downwards at Beth-el-Walli, a temple was hewn in
the rocks at the west side of the Nile, the sculptures
of which exhibit the exploits of Ramses II. against
the Negroes, and the booty of these campaigns&mdash;gazelles,
ostriches, giraffes (<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>); while the ruins of
the temple which he built beside the larger one of his
father to Osiris at Abydus, is evidence of the honour
which he paid to his predecessors in the kingdom
(pp. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>, <a href="#Page_169">169</a>).</p>

<p>Herodotus and Diodorus told us that Sesostris had
set up before the temple of Heph&aelig;stus (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Ptah)
at Memphis statues of himself, his wife, and his sons,
on a colossal scale (<a href="#Page_146">p. 146</a>). In the ruins of Memphis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
(at the village of Mitrahinneh) there lies, surrounded
by green turf and tall palms, in a depression, the
prostrate statue of Ramses II. hewn out of a single
block. The feet are wanting, the head wears the crown
of Upper and Lower Egypt; in the middle of the girdle
are engraved the words Mi Amun Ramses, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Ramses
beloved of Ammon. From the knees upwards the
fragment measures thirty-five feet; on this scale the
total height must have reached forty-two or forty-three
feet. At Tanis in the Delta, Ramses II. built or
restored a great temple, and erected obelisks. The
inscriptions on the ruins speak of his victories in
Syria. Here also lies a prostrate and shattered
colossus; the name-shields on the back of the throne
are those of the second Ramses.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Of the buildings of
this king for the sepulchral chambers of the Apis bulls at
Memphis, the fortification of the border towards Syria,
and the canal, we have spoken above (pp. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>, <a href="#Page_157">157</a>).</p>

<p>On the left bank of the Nile, westwards of the
temple and the two colossi of Amenophis III., at
Medinet Habu, Ramses III. built a splendid temple.
A magnificent gate flanked by broad wings sixty-six
feet in height leads from the east to the first ante-court,
which, as always, is surrounded by a portico, partly
supported by massive pillars, and partly by statues of
Osiris. From this court a second somewhat smaller
gateway leads into a second court; the portico surrounding
this is supported to the right and left on
strong columns, of seven feet in diameter, the capitals of
which are formed by lotus-leaves, and on each of the
other sides by eight Osiris pillars. The columns and
pillars, in spite of their massiveness, do not seem too
heavy to support the blocks which form the roof of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the portico. In this court we find the four pictures
which represent the war of Ramses III. against the
Libyans (<a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>). The ante-temple, to which the
entrance lay between the Osiris pillars just mentioned,
the inner temple, and the shrine, are in ruins; the
bases only and the foundations can still be traced. In
the ten reliefs mentioned above the external wall of
the second court displays in the most brilliant colours
the warlike achievements of Ramses III. against the
Temhu and Zakkarj (<a href="#Page_165">p. 165</a>). About 120 steps to
the south-east of the first gateway are the ruins of
another structure of this king, which appears to have
been his palace. Two obliquely rising towers enclose
a court, surrounded by a building several stories high.
The rooms still remaining are paved with slabs; the
windows are square. The reliefs represent the king
surrounded by his wives, and then at draughts, the
instruction which his children receive in reading and
writing from a priest, and other household matters.
On the right bank of the Nile at the south-west edge
of the terrace of Karnak, Ramses III. began to build
a temple to the moon-god Chunsu, which was completed
by Ramses IV.; and at Karnak itself, in the court
before the great hall of Sethos I., he erected a smaller
temple, cutting the southern portico of this temple at
right angles, which he dedicated to "Ammon Ra,
his father," to whom the whole sanctuary belonged.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>As at Memphis, so also at Thebes, great care was
taken for the dead. Not far from the city, in the first
Libyan range of hills, which here rise 300 feet out of
the plain, lie the tombs of the inhabitants of Thebes,
running on into these hills for two hours' distance in
an unbroken series of catacombs. The graves, and
the passages which lead to them, are all hewn in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
rock, sometimes to a considerable depth. Several rows
of chambers lie one over the other. In the lower
rows, where the richer class are buried, the chambers
are larger and more handsome; those in the upper
rows are simpler, smaller, and meaner. Staircases,
straight or winding, connect these stories and
chambers with each other. Galleries, gangways, and
perpendicular shafts break the rows of excavations,
and give to this city of the dead the features of
an inextricable labyrinth. These catacombs, with
their thousands of mummies, innumerable chambers
full of papyrus rolls and amulets buried with the
corpses, with their sculptures and frescoes on the walls
and roofs, which are for the most part preserved in
marvellous brilliancy and represent in the truest and
most varied manner the occupation of every person
buried there of the higher orders, are an almost inexhaustible
source for the knowledge of the life and
the habits of that distant time.</p>

<p>Separated from the first range of hills by a lonely
and desolate ravine, there rises further to the west a
second wall of rock, which the Arabs call Biban-el-Moluk,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the gates of the kings. In this lie the
largest and most richly-furnished tombs. The kings
of the old monarchy heaped mountains of stone over
their graves at Memphis, and in like manner the princes
of the new kingdom caused vaults and porticoes to
be hewn in the rocks for their sepulchral chambers.
Here in antiquity forty tombs were enumerated,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and
the latest investigations have confirmed this enumera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>tion.
Spacious, but often barred, passages lead
sometimes only fifty, sometimes 360 feet into the rock.
The greater part of the tombs consist of a suite of
galleries, chambers, and chapels for the offering of
sacrifices to the dead; these are followed by the
sepulchral chamber, where rests the sarcophagus, sometimes
in a deep niche. The Pharaohs of Thebes
appear to have carried on their work upon these burying-places
in the same manner as the princes of the old
kingdom proceeded with the building of their pyramids.
They commenced with the entrance, the ante-chapel (a
broad and not very long portico, generally supported
on pillars), and a small chamber, the real sepulchre.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> If
the length of the reign sufficed, a new passage was
driven deeper into the rock from the chamber, a new
and larger ante-chapel, a wider and higher sepulchral
chamber was excavated. All the graves as yet opened
and examined in this wall of rock are entered by
square doors of uniform shape, with simple ornamentation.
At one time they were provided with wings for
security in closing. Behind them the corridor descends
somewhat rapidly into the deep rock. As a rule the
sculptures on the inner walls begin from the doors
immediately behind this entrance. The colouring is
still lively, not to say harsh.</p>

<p>The oldest tombs lie to the north-east; but as yet
only two chambers have been opened here, one of
which is large in size and adorned with beautiful,
though very much injured sculptures, the grave of
Amenophis III.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The tombs of the Tuthmosis have
not yet been found. Next, on the south-west, lies the
tomb of Ramses I. The rock chamber and the
granite sarcophagus, which is still standing there, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
without any ornament whatever except a few pictures
on the walls, in which the god Tum and the goddess
Neith, the great mother, the lady of heaven, the
queen of the deities, lead the king before Osiris. The
king speaks, "I have come to thee, lord of the gods,
mighty god, master of the sky," while Neith says to
the king, "I secure to thee the throne of Osiris, on
which thou shalt sit for ever."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The grave of his
successor, Sethos I., consists of a suite of galleries,
chambers, and chapels. A corridor leads to a staircase,
which ends in a chamber; from this a second
staircase leads to a portico, on which abuts a great
hall, the roof of which is supported by four pillars.
A third staircase leads from this hall on the left into
one similarly adorned, of which the pictures remain
unfinished, and on the right into a broad vaulted
portico sunk more than 300 feet deep into the rock.
The roof of this portico is supported by six pillars.
Here the corpse of the king rested in a sarcophagus of
alabaster, which is covered with sculptures. The
sarcophagus, now in the British Museum, was empty
when found, and the cover was broken. The sculptures
of the first hall display on every side of the
pillars the king and a deity. Those on the walls represent
the stations of the nightly course of the sun
and the hindrances thrown in the way of the sun by the
serpent Apep (<a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>), the judgment in the under world,
the reward of the good, the punishment of the bad, the
constellations of the sky, the five planets in their boats,
and the four tribes into which the Egyptians divided
mankind. Each tribe is represented by four figures.</p>

<p>Of the grave of Ramses II. but few chambers have
as yet been opened.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The grave of his son Menephta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
presents nothing more than a picture referring to
the under world. Beside Menephta, Amenmessu
(<a href="#Page_162">p. 162</a>) and Menephta's son, Sethos II., found their
resting places in these rocks, which also conceal
Menephta II. (<a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>). The grave of Sethos II. is
distinguished by paintings and sculptures. The sarcophagus
of red granite is intended to exhibit on the
lid the image of the king, but this remained unfinished.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
The grave of Ramses III. comes nearest to
that of Sethos I. in size and splendour of adornment.
Galleries following one upon the other, on the side of
which are small chambers, lead to a large portico in
which rests the sarcophagus. The sculptures in these
chambers exhibit scenes of court life, of agriculture,
of the banquet, musicians, boats, and weapons; those
of the galleries and the portico represent scenes of the
under world and existence beyond the grave. The
grave of Ramses IV., far smaller and incomplete, still
contains the shattered sarcophagus of granite.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> On the
other hand, the tomb of Ramses V., one of the most
handsome, displays on the arching of the roof of the
great portico, where the sarcophagus stood, the outstretched
form of the goddess of the sky, in
which are enclosed the stars. On the walls are
depicted the fortunes of the soul in the next world,
and the king in the boat of the sun-god. These
representations of the judgment in the under-world,
which recur perpetually in the tombs at Biban-el-Moluk,
and of the life to come, are wholly unknown
to the pyramids and the tombs surrounding them, the
burying-places of the ancient kingdom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>LIFE AND MANNERS OF THE EGYPTIANS.</h3>


<p>We have already called attention to the peculiar
features in the position and nature of their country
which favoured the development of the Egyptians.
The shape of the land, so conducive to unity,
must have led at an early time to a community of
life; the protection of this favoured valley against the
plundering tribes of the desert must have called into
existence a military monarchy. But it is no longer in
the form of a patriarchal rule or military chieftainship
that the monuments and tradition display the government
of Egypt. It is the form of despotism peculiar
to the East, which meets us at the threshold of
history, meets us, too, in a very sharply-defined form.
Herodotus says that the Egyptians could not have
lived without a king, and Diodorus tells us that the
Egyptians worshipped their kings, and prostrated
themselves before them as though they were really
gods. Of men who could confer such great blessings
as their kings the Egyptians assumed that they
partook of the nature of gods.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> As a fact, we see on
the monuments not only the commanders and magistrates
of the districts, but even the priests, in the dust
before the kings. It is true that it was the universal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
custom in the East to approach the ruler kneeling, as
one on whose nod depended the life and death of every
subject at every moment of his existence; but the
Egyptians, led by their peculiar religious views, have
gone further than any other nation in the exaltation of
the power of the monarch; they worshipped their kings
as the deities of the land. As in the beginning,
according to the teaching of the priests, the gods ruled
over Egypt, so in subsequent times the Pharaohs
occupy the place of the gods. They do not merely spring
from the gods; they are themselves gods of the land.
They are not only called children of the sun; but to
their subjects they are the "sun itself, which is given to
the world," which beams over the land and gives
blessing and increase; they are the "outpourers of
life," like the gods. Like the gods, they are lords of
truth and justice; they preserve order, punish the
bad, and reward the good, and keep away the unclean
enemies; through their care it is that their subjects
share in the fruits of the earth, hence they cause
Egypt to live. The king of Egypt is called, and is,
"the mighty Horus," the god who gives blessing to
the land. If to the Egyptians animals and men were
the manifestations of the divine nature, must they
not recognise such manifestations in peculiar potency
in the life of the king, in the ruling, arranging, and
sustaining power of the king over the whole land?
This conception of the king as a god on earth has been
already brought before us in the inscription on the
statue of Chafra, the builder of the second largest
pyramid, which describes him as the "good god, the
master and gold Horus" (<a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>). It continues unchanged
to the last centuries of the kingdom, and
even survives the independence of Egypt. In the
inscriptions of the temples the Ptolemies and Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
C&aelig;sars are named by the same solemn titles as the
ancient Pharaohs.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>We saw that priests were allotted to the spirits of
the buried kings (<a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>). In the ruins at Luxor,
spirits of heaven are carrying Amenophis III. into
the presence of Ammon, who consecrates him king
(<a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>). In the Ramesseum and in the palace at
Medinet Habu we have pictures of the coronation of
Ramses II. and Ramses III. In both, the four geese
of the four spirits of heaven are bidden by the
priest to announce to the spirits of the east and
west, of the north and the south, that the king has
put on the double crown. In the rock temple at
Selseleh (<a href="#Page_149">p. 149</a>), the goddess Anuke gives her breast to
king Horus, who is depicted as already grown into a
youth; in the rock temple at Beth-el-Walli, Isis and
Anuke allow Ramses II. to suck at their breasts. In
the Ramesseum, Ramses II. is led by the gods Mentu
and Chunsu and the goddess Mut before Ammon
(<a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>). These pictures, in which gods bring the
kings before Ammon, and worship him, that he may
bestow life and purity on the princes presented by
them, are constantly recurring. On the monuments
the kings are found sacrificing, not only to their
divine forefathers, but also to themselves and their
own divinity (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>). Tuthmosis III. dedicated a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
temple to the god Sesurtesen III., and ordained regular
sacrifices to him; and Amenophis III. built a temple
in Nubia to his own divinity (pp. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>, <a href="#Page_137">137</a>).</p>

<p>Nowhere do we find a trace to show that the kings
stood in need of the intervention of the priests in
order to approach the gods, and without such intervention
there can be no supremacy of the priests
over the sovereigns of the state. Everywhere the
kings come independently before the gods. Everywhere
we find the sacrifices of the kings, not of the
priests, offered. It is the kings who consecrate
temples to the gods, in order that the king may
obtain "lasting life and purity." It is the Pharaohs
and not the priests who represent the state and people
before the gods. The kings are at the same time the
high priests, and stand at the head of religion as at
the head of the state; their sons and grandsons, their
mothers, wives, and daughters, are, according to the
inscriptions, the priests of this or that god or goddess.
The kings, as Diodorus assures us, were not waited
upon by slaves, but by the sons of the most distinguished
priests; by priests only could the ruling
god of the country be served&mdash;and the priests did
not omit to mention on their tombs, even at a very
early period, the king in whose service they were
prophets, scribes, and minstrels. In a word, the
Pharaoh was not merely the head of the state, but
also of the church, if such an expression may be
allowed, and the power of the priests, without any
real and ceremonial support, does not extend beyond
the moral influence which religion exercised upon the
heart of the king. Finally, it is the kings who are
celebrated as the lawgivers of the land, and this excludes
any thought of a supremacy of priests. Yet
the influence of religion and of the priesthood on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the king is not to be contested, although, under the
military princes who governed Egypt after the expulsion
of the Hyksos, the priests had to share their influence
with the leaders of the army. Not till the time of
Menephta, do we observe a more influential position
assumed by the high priests at Thebes. This influence
goes on increasing under the weak successors
of Ramses III., and reaches its summit under the
first princes of the dynasty of Tanis. Then it declined,
and afterwards only came into operation under
foreign supremacy.</p>

<p>If further proof were needed for the unlimited
power of the kings than their representation of Ra
and Horus, and the menial position of the priests, we
should find it in the gigantic structures which the
Pharaohs left behind them. To carry out works of
this kind is impossible unless the monarch has absolute
disposal of the labour of his subjects. But these
buildings were undoubtedly the main interest and the
main occupation of the kings. In this they follow the
characteristic traits of the whole nation. In building
temples and erecting images, their object was just as
much to confer honour on the gods as to preserve the
remembrance of the homage which they had offered to
them. The preservation of their own actions and
names, which these buildings in the eyes of the
Egyptians "caused to live," is the main object of the
structure, and along with the sacrifices of the kings,
and the evidence of the favour of the gods, the
sculptures on the temples display the martial exploits
of the kings. If the kings erected pyramid tombs,
it was in order that their corpses might rest in
security, and the tumulus "cause their name to
live" in the generations to come. If they built
temples, it was that the gates, walls, frescoes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
inscriptions might preserve their acts for posterity.
The buildings of the Pharaohs are the history of their
reigns written in stone.</p>

<p>The ceremonial which surrounded the life of the
Pharaohs is described by Diodorus. In the morning
the king first read the communications received from
every quarter; then he performed his ablutions,
put on his robes, and offered sacrifice to the gods.
While the sacrificial animal was being led to the altar
the high priest offered prayer to the gods, beseeching
them to grant life and all good things to the
king, as he was a righteous ruler. He was pious to
the gods, gentle towards men, strong, just, and
courageous, an enemy of lies, a sharer of his goods
with others, and master of his desires; one who did not
punish the wicked so severely as they deserved, and
gave to the good more than their proportionate share.
Then the priest laid the punishment of any error into
which the king might have fallen on his servants, and
urged him to a pious life, "not by reproaches," as
Diodorus expressly observes, "but by commendations."
When the sacrifice was finished, the priest read to the
king the apothegms and achievements of distinguished
men, that is, no doubt, of previous kings, out of the
sacred books. We know that poems of considerable
extent on historical subjects were in existence.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> In
the same way the remaining part of the day was
allotted to definite occupations. For walking, for
bathing, even for sleeping with the queen, definite
hours were appointed. The king might only eat the
flesh of calves and geese&mdash;the food of the priests&mdash;and
take a fixed portion of wine. Diodorus regards it as
wonderful that the kings should have subjected themselves
to this ceremonial. In this he leaves out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
sight the fact that the god of the land was expected
to lead the life of a god, and also, a thing which could
not indeed be so obvious to him, that all periods
present proofs to what oppressive rules of state and
etiquette rulers are willing to subject themselves in
order to exhibit their dignity and majesty. Yet this
was not the object chiefly held in view in the regulation
of the king's life, nor was it the love of the
Egyptians for systematic and fixed arrangements.
The king was at the same time the first priest of the
land; and therefore the regulations of the priestly
life applied to him also. Moreover, the Egyptians
were extremely careful to keep themselves pure from
the unclean, in order by such purity to preserve life
and salvation. With this object, priests and laity alike
regulated all their actions, their eating and drinking,
feeding and clothing, by a minute ritual. It was the
first duty of the king to protect the purity of Egypt.
He was the Horus of the land, who had struck down
disorder, impurity, and evil, and therefore, like the
victorious god, he must shine out in the brightness of
unsullied purity. Thus the king had to lead the pure
life of a priest; he could eat none but the priestly
food, and every duty must be performed at a
favourable moment, for the Egyptians were under the
dominion of a widespread astrological superstition.
This system further required that every fault he
might happen to commit should be taken from him
and laid upon others. It is probably the plan
sketched by the priests for the king's life, of which
Diodorus has preserved some traces; we know that
among the sacred books those of the minstrels contained
regulations for the life of the king. Whatever
flattery and homage was thus intended for the great
and gracious king, the Pharaohs no doubt observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
so much as seemed suitable to them. Of a later king,
Amasis, we are told that he emancipated himself from
the customary ceremonial, and when business was
over, gave himself up to relaxation and enjoyment.
Yet his reign was a long one, and regarded with
affection by the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The Pharaohs were surrounded with all the state of
Oriental despots. On the picture of the coronation,
the assumption of the Pschent by Ramses III. at
Medinet Habu, the procession is led by trumpeters,
who are followed by commanders and magistrates.
Twenty-two priests lead the statue of Ammon, who
is followed by a priest with incense, and a scribe who
appears to read a proclamation. The king is then
carried in by twelve richly-attired men on a throne
under a canopy. Beside the throne walk certain
officers, who cool the king with large fans; others
carry the weapons of the king and the insignia of
his power. Behind follow the captains of the army
and the body-guard. Then a white bull is led in the
procession by priests, and the whole closes with priests
carrying the name-shields of the predecessors of the
king. On descending from the throne the king makes
a libation towards Ammon, burns incense to him, and
cuts off some ears of corn with a golden sickle.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The
court was numerous: fan-bearers on the right, and
fan-bearers on the left, bearers of the parasol, keepers
of the king's bow, captains of the body-guard, overseers
of the palace, overseers of the buildings in
Upper and Lower Egypt, overseers of the horses,
books, and music, stewards of the granaries in
Upper and Lower Egypt, stewards of the royal
flocks, treasurers, butlers of the palace, and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
officers are mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> According to the monuments,
the king's household furniture was profuse in
silver and gold. The gondolas were gilded, with
variegated sails, the trappings of the horses were
splendidly ornamented, the stuffed seats curiously
carved and richly decked; and of the complicated
occupations of the royal kitchen, of the number of
people employed, of cup-bearers and master cooks,
as well as of the preparation of the food&mdash;the monuments
give us a very complete idea.</p>

<p>The death of the king was mourned for seventy
days, like the death of an Apis. During this time
everyone had to abstain from baths, from flesh and
wine, until the son of the ruler, who had entered
into Amenti, ascended the throne as a new Horus and
giver of life to the land, and the visage of the new
lord again "beamed like a sun over both the lands of
Egypt" after the days of lamentation. The succession,
so far as we can see, was not infrequently broken
by usurpations, which have always been inseparable
from the despotic form of government.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>It is characteristic of the all-absorbing power of
the monarchy in Egypt that tradition can scarcely
mention a single eminent person beside the names
of the kings. We hear nothing of generals or
statesmen, and scarcely of priests. All stood in
equal subjection to the king. Though families may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
have at one time arisen from the nation, which were
in a position, from wealth and inclination, to undertake
the defence of the valley of the Nile against the
tribes of the desert, and though the monarchy may
have arisen out of the ranks of this military nobility,
which in bygone times united the valley of the Nile
into a kingdom, still, so far as the monuments allow
us to see, there is no trace left of the eminent position
of any nobility, whether military or hereditary. The
military order, as presented to us on the monuments,
and by the tradition of the Greeks, no longer consisted
of wealthy landowners who went to war at
the bidding of the king with their chariots and horses
and retainers; they are merely soldiers&mdash;families, who
for a certain portion of land given to them by the
state are pledged to service in war, and who receive
their weapons from the armouries of the state. Such
are the warriors on the monuments even in the times of
the Amenemha and Sesurtesen, and also under Ramses
III. Herodotus tells us that each family of warriors
possessed twelve measures of good land, free of taxes,
the measure being 100 Egyptian cubits in length and
breadth. This would make the allotment more than
twelve acres. These families, according to Herodotus,
could, even about the middle of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>,
put in the field 400,000 men, although two hundred
years before, under Psammetichus I., a large number
of them, it is said more than 200,000, migrated
into Ethiopia. The military order was divided into
two classes: the Hermotybians, numbering at most
160,000 men, and the Kalasirians, about 250,000
strong. In the time of Herodotus, the first were
settled in Upper Egypt in the province of Chemmis,
and mainly in the western Delta; the Kalasirians
were in the province of Thebes, and in the central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and eastern Delta.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Each division furnished yearly
1,000 men for the bodyguard of the king, who were
handsomely provided for, and the garrisons in the
border towns and strongholds, which were also relieved
year by year. From the masses of the two divisions
so many may have been told off for field duty as
were considered necessary. From the numbers which
Herodotus gives it is not impossible that the armies of
Sethos and Ramses II., when all the soldiers were called
out, were, if not 700,000, yet from 400,000 to 500,000
strong. Under Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-247 <small>B.C.</small>)
the army of Egypt was estimated at 240,000 men.</p>

<p>The monuments prove that even at the time of
the Sesurtesen and Amenemha, war was scientifically
carried on, and the soldiers regularly drilled. From
the royal armouries the infantry were provided with
bows, helmets, shields, lances, and crooked knives,
and were divided into battalions, each carrying its own
ensign. The heavy infantry moved in ranks to the
sound of trumpets. Attacks were not made on fortified
cities without the ram, and sheds to protect the
attacking party. Instead of cavalry, which never
occur on the monuments, we find, though not till
after the time of the Hyksos, numerous war-chariots
in use. Those who fought in the chariots, as the
kings, who are invariably represented as fighting from
a chariot, made use of bows. The monuments often
exhibit practice in archery. With the Egyptians,
as with the whole of the East in antiquity, the bow
was the favourite weapon.</p>

<p>To the priestly order Egypt owed the growth and
establishment of her cultus, the peculiar turn of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
religious conceptions, her moral law, her writings, her
art, and her science. The piety of the people and
the kings had amply endowed the temples. "The
priests eat nothing of their own," says Herodotus;
"sacred bread is daily baked for them, and they
obtain vegetables, geese, calves' flesh, and wine
in sufficient quantities."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Diodorus tells us that
the land in ancient Egypt was divided into three
portions, of which a third belonged to the kings, a
third to the priests for their support and the maintenance
of the sacrifices and festivals, and another third
to the military order, and that all the farmers in Egypt
held on leases;<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and we have already seen that at any
rate a part of the land, though by no means so much
as a third, was really allotted to the soldiers, who
could scarcely have leased their small patches, but
must have cultivated them in person if they wished to
live upon them with their families. Another part of
the land was marked off for the maintenance of the
priests and the expenses of public worship; but it
appears that this land also belonged to the king, for
Herodotus speaks of the incomes of the priests as gifts
received from the king;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and the Hebrew Scriptures
also tell us that "the priests had a portion assigned
them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> From these data&mdash;even if the
statement of Herodotus, that Sesostris (Ramses II.) had
given an equal square of land to every Egyptian, must
be limited to a measurement of the land, in order to
regulate the taxes<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>&mdash;it appears that the Pharaohs
looked on themselves as the proprietors of the soil&mdash;a
view by no means strange to the despotisms of the
East&mdash;and in consequence they allotted to the soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
so much as was necessary, and of the rest allowed a
great portion, which was estimated at a third of the
whole, to pay taxes to the temples, while the remainder
contributed to themselves. According to the statements
of the Hebrews the taxes amounted to a fifth of the
produce,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and hence all the farmers could with justice be
considered leaseholders, or at any rate as having copyhold
estates. It is expressly observed that only the
farms of the soldiers were free from taxes,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and that
the land which was taxed for the temples contributed
nothing to Pharaoh.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> At the same time it is easily
intelligible that the piety of the subjects provided
additional incomes for the priests, and that, so far as
it was possible to make any arrangements of the kind,
land and revenues were presented to the temples.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>The maintenance which they derived from the incomes
and contributions of the temple-lands, in corn,
wine, and animals for sacrifice, enabled the priests to
live for their religious duties, for the complete per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>formance
of their customs in regard to purification and
food, and for the study of the holy scriptures. They
were divided into various classes and corporations. In
every temple there was one upper priest,&mdash;the head of
the temple&mdash;the prophet,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> a temple scribe, who was
especially skilled in writing, and managed the temple
property, a chamberlain, who took care of the clothing
of the images, the sacrifices, and the ritual, an
astronomer, who had to observe the heavens, and a
minstrel. In the processions the prophet carried the jar
of water for purifications; the chamberlain carried the
cubit of justice and a basin for sprinkling water; the
scribe can be recognised by the feather in his head-dress,
the roll of books in one hand, and the pen in the other;
the astronomer by an hour-glass and a palm branch,
the symbol of the seasons among the Egyptians.
These higher classes of the priesthood were followed by
the lower; the pastophors, who carried the images in
the processions, and practised medicine, the attendants,
male and female ("the nurses"), of the sacred
animals, the persons whose duty it was to select
and seal the animals for sacrifice, the embalmers,
and lastly, the temple-servants, who were responsible
for the purifications. The first sanctuaries in Egypt
were the temples of Ammon at Thebes, of Ptah at
Memphis, and of Ra at Heliopolis. The colleges at
these temples were the most important centres of
priestly life and doctrine. So long as Thebes was the
metropolis of the kingdom, the high priest of Ammon
at Thebes was the first priest in the land. Herodotus
tells us from the lips of the priests of Thebes that the
office of high priest descended from father to son, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Diodorus maintains that the same was the case with
all the officers of the temples.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> These statements are
contradicted by the inscriptions. They mention five
places in the temples through which all "fifth priests"
must pass. From a memorial stone of a priest,
Bakenchunsu, we learn that for fifteen years he was
third priest, and for twelve years second priest of
Ammon at Thebes; then he became first priest of
this god, and continued to be so to the end of his life.</p>

<p>The priests had to lead a holier and purer life
than the laity. The ritual, the rules for purification
and food, which the priests laid upon themselves, were
stricter than those expected from the rest of the
people. The priest must wash twice in each day and
each night. Every third day he must shave his whole
body, more especially his eyebrows and beard. He
might only wear linen clothing (byssus), and shoes of
papyrus. Any other clothing, and especially the hair
and skins of beasts, defiled a priest; though on monuments
the priests of Osiris wear leopard skins, especially
at the ceremony of the burial. The flesh of sheep,
swine, and most other animals was forbidden to the
priests; they might never touch fish. Pulse they
might not eat, and beans were not even to be looked
at. They observed frequent fasts. From time to
time they underwent certain mortifications, which in
one instance continued for forty-two days, in order
to destroy in themselves the forty-two deadly sins.
Finally the priests could only marry one wife; while
the laity were allowed to have other wives beside the
first. The kings had more than one wife, and this was
the rule among the wealthier class in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>We are not informed how sharply the different orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
in Egypt were separated, or how far the different occupations
were distinguished among the labouring or
trading population in addition to the classes of priests
and soldiers. We do not know, for instance, in what
degree the tiller of the soil was distinguished from
the artizan. We are only told that the people were
divided into husbandmen, artizans, and shepherds,
and the shepherds were regarded as the lowest class.
But we learn that no one was allowed to follow any
other occupation than that derived from his father.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
The inscriptions tell us that the same office, as for
instance that of architect, remained in the same
family for twenty-three generations;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and in the
seventh century <small>B.C.</small> a kind of caste grew up out of
a number of Egyptian boys, whom Psammetichus
handed over to his Ionian mercenaries. Hence we may
conclude that the impulse to perpetuate types and
lock up occupations in hereditary circles and fixed
families was very strong, as was natural enough with
the fixed and conservative character of the Egyptians.
But however strong the impulse, however deeply rooted
the custom for the son to follow the father's profession,
there was in Egypt no caste in the strict sense of the
term. Marriages between the orders were not forbidden,
and it is exclusiveness in this point which
completes the idea of caste. Moreover in Egypt there
were adoptions and transitions from one order to
another. The sepulchral pillars never lay any weight
on birth in a certain order, but rather show that
members of the same family had belonged to different
orders&mdash;that a man could be at once a priest and a
soldier, and Diodorus remarks that in Egypt all were
regarded as of equally honourable birth. The statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
that the shepherds were held in the least estimation is
probably correct, for the reason that their unrestrained
occupation was least adapted for subjection to fixed rules
of life and a strict ritual; but that statement, like the
assertion in Genesis that "cowherds were an abomination
to the Egyptians," is not to be taken in reference
to the breeders of oxen and the care of flocks, which
was carried on with great vigour among the Egyptians,
but to the nomadic tribes who wandered with their
flocks on the broad marshes of the Delta, or on the
pastures of the Libyan and Arabian ranges, and were
wholly strangers to all settled life. When we are told
that the swineherds were held in especial contempt,
we must remember that to the Egyptians the swine
was an unclean animal.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Hence we may consider it as
certain that custom required the Egyptian to follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the trade of his father, and caused the father to live
again in his son, but no law of religion or state turned
the orders into castes, and that the various classes of
trades and professions were neither haughty and
exclusive, nor servile and submissive towards each
other, but all lived together on a tolerable equality.</p>

<p>Beside the respect and weight which the religious
importance of their order, their general knowledge
and science gave to the priests, it was to them more
especially that the honour of serving the king fell.
We cannot doubt that the public officers were mainly
taken from the order of priests, which was also the
order of scribes. Egypt was not, like the great
monarchies of the ancient East, a state founded by
conquest, in which the lord of the victorious people
was master of the conquerors and the conquered
also, and in which it was all-important to retain the
conquered nation in subjection; it was a compact
district inhabited by the same tribe. Here, if we
make an exception in favour of the transitory conquests
in Nubia and Arabia, there were no extensive
and distant provinces to be held in check. The departments
in the land were small, their number reached
forty-four;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> the officers, whom the king set over
them, were in his sight, they could not assume the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
position of refractory pashas. They were nominated
out of the members of the royal house (the monuments
furnish instances), the priests, the soldiers, and also
out of the people. Royal scribes and judges, "scribes
of justice," were allotted to these prefects. As the
Egyptians early arrived at a written law, as religion
and justice were closely connected, and the priests
were acquainted with the art of writing, the prefects of
the provinces were without doubt assisted by men from
the priestly order in the exercise of their judicial duties.
Besides the maintenance of the peace and the administration
of justice, it was their duty to provide for the
cultivation of the land, the collection and transmission
of the taxes to the king. Even the soldiers settled in
the provinces seem to have been subject to their rule.
The gold and copper mines on the Upper Nile and in
Sinai appear to have been put under the care of special
officers, and the products were conveyed under military
protection to the treasury of the king (<a href="#Page_105">p. 105</a>).</p>

<p>The officers of the central government surrounded
the person of the king (<a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>). Even the administration
of justice, according to Diodorus, was centred
in a supreme court, consisting of thirty judges, ten
of the best men from Heliopolis, ten from Memphis,
and ten from Thebes. Without doubt these judges
belonged to the three priestly colleges of Memphis,
Thebes, and Heliopolis. From these thirty the
president was chosen, and on his breast, attached to
a golden chain, he wore a shield of precious stones,
beautifully wrought, which the Egyptians named
"Truth" (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>). This court of the thirty no doubt
gave very honourable decisions, and in accordance
with law, unless the king were interested in the
result, or preferred to pass sentence himself. Diodorus
further informs us that the laws of the Egyptians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
were collected in eight books, and were always kept
at hand by the judges. The first written laws were
given by Menes to the Egyptians, who declared that
he had received them from the god Thoth. These
laws had been enlarged by "Sasychis," who at the
same time left the most accurate rubrics for the
service of the gods, discovered geometry, and taught
astronomy. Then Sesosis (Sesostris) laid down the
laws for the kings, and the army. Finally the
kings Bocchoris and Amasis completed the laws of
Egypt. Herodotus praises a king "Asychis," whom he
places after Menkera (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>), as the giver of the laws
of mortgage. From Diodorus we also learn, and the
monuments confirm his statement, that a written
process went on before the court, that plaint and
answer, rejoinder and reply, were given in, in writing;
and this custom, considering the delight of the Egyptians
in writing, did not appear for the first time in
the later period of legal administration. The contracts
and bills of sale found in tombs of the time of the
Ptolemies are drawn up with the most circumstantial
accuracy, and furnished with the signatures of
many witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> What Diodorus tells us of the law of
Egypt with respect to <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> gives evidence
of a certain gentleness and humanity. The interest
was never to exceed the amount of the capital.
Slavery for debt was not allowed; the sons of all
the wives shared equally in the inheritance. The
murder of a slave was punished with death, just as
the murder of an Egyptian. Perjury was threatened
with the same penalty. Anyone who falsified documents
or measures had his hand cut off. In the
confession which the souls made before Osiris (<a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
especial emphasis is laid on the fact that the dead
man had not falsified measures or seals, that he had
practised no deceit in the law court, and had lent
no money upon usury. The punishments inflicted on
the guilty are characteristic of the East: the stocks,
compulsory labour at the mines and quarries, loss of
the nose, excision of the tongue, and mutilation were
the usual penalties.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Beside the law of the state stood the law of religion,
of the priests. It was not sufficient to offer bread,
and geese, and thighs of bulls, to pour drink-offerings
of milk and wine, and "all things whereon the divine
nature lives," to burn frankincense before the images
of the gods, to offer the firstlings of the fruits, figs,
onions, and flowers, to set up in the temples dedicatory
offerings, small statues, crowns, and rings, to celebrate
in honour of the gods of the district the great and
small festivals, to honour the dead and bring sacrifice
to them at the beginning and end of the year, at
the festivals of the great and the little heat, on the
monthly and fortnightly festivals (the calendars of
the festivals on the monuments exhibit an almost
unbroken series of sacrifices), to attend to the animals
of the sacred kinds and bury them handsomely, "to
give bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothes
to the naked, and shelter to the wanderer"&mdash;the
whole life must be a religious service. In their
favoured land the Egyptians considered themselves
a favoured people. Full of gratitude to the gods
who had given them this land and this life, they
looked with contempt on the unclean and perverse
nations who dwelt beyond the valley of the Nile.
To keep themselves clean from the unclean is the
essential task of their lives. To the merely superficial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
view, cleanliness of body and clothing seems cleanliness
of soul and life. But this purity, which the law
of the priests required from every Egyptian, and
above all and in an especial degree from the priests,
was not limited to simple and natural cleanliness.
There were beneficent life-giving gods, and there were
also evil and destructive deities. To these belonged
the side of nature which seemed to correspond to
their being. Contact with this side of nature is not
only displeasing to the good and pure gods, it gives
the evil influences power over the men contaminated
by it. Hence for the salvation of men such contact
must be shunned. Certain things must be avoided for
clothing and others for nourishment, certain impulses
must not be satisfied, or must at any rate be limited.</p>

<p>This conception introduced certain usages and customs,
which were developed by the priests into a system
of rules for purification and food. Herodotus says,
"the Egyptians are the most religious of all men;
they have a severe and strict service, and many sacred
customs." The boys were circumcised. Beans, rye,
and barley might not be eaten; the flesh of many
animals and many kinds of fish was forbidden. It
was not lawful to eat the head of any animal. The
animals for sacrifice must first be examined by the
priests, to see that they did not belong to the sacred
kinds&mdash;to sacrifice these was an inexpiable offence&mdash;and
whether in other respects they were without
blemish and pleasing to the gods. This examination
was the duty of the class of temple-servants already
mentioned, and it devolved on them to mark the animals
found to be clean with a seal, which in bulls was
placed on the horns. The Egyptians never ate at the
same table with strangers, nor used a cup from which
a stranger had drunk, nor ate flesh cooked in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
vessel of a stranger and cut with a stranger's knife;
all strangers and their utensils were unclean. Nothing
woollen might be taken into a temple or a tomb. The
Egyptians always wore newly-washed under-clothing
of linen; they were obliged frequently to wash their
bodies, and for three days in each month they used
means of evacuation, clysters and emetics, in order to
cleanse the body internally.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> These statements are
confirmed by papyrus rolls containing medicinal precepts.
If the king, a sacred animal, or a member of
the family died, no one was allowed to wear white
or bright-coloured clothes; he must shave his eyebrows,
and abstain from intercourse with his wife and from
baths. Men and women threw dust on their heads
and faces, and the women ran to and fro wailing
with bare breasts.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>If an Egyptian had not committed murder, theft,
or adultery, if he had not defamed the gods nor the
king, nor those in authority over him, nor his own
father, if he were not guilty of lying or slandering,
if he had deceived neither gods nor men, nor oppressed
his workmen in their daily tasks, nor drawn off the
water, if he had allowed no one to be hungry, and
caused no one to weep, if he were not slothful and
idle in his occupation, if he sacrificed to the gods at
the appointed time, and poured libations and observed
all the regulations for cleanliness, then he might hope
to find grace in the presence of the twenty-four judges
before Osiris on the day of judgment in Amenti (<a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>).
In order to gain by such conduct and careful observation
of the laws of cleanliness and the ritual, a long life in
this world, rest in the grave, and eternal life in the
fields of the sun-god, the Egyptians worshipped their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
gods with unwearied zeal, while their kings raised
temple upon temple of enormous blocks in honour
of the life-giving powers of heaven.</p>

<p>We cannot rate the knowledge and science of the
Egyptians very low, however absurd and singular
much in it appears to be. The early discovery of
writing, however unwieldy the form, gave them the
means of preserving not only invocations and incidents,
but also the results of observation and experience,
and of increasing slowly and surely their stock
of knowledge. They made an unusually extensive
use of writing. The walls of the temples are covered
with inscriptions, which often enough only repeat once
more what has been repeated already innumerable times.
Even in the tombs at Beni Hassan from the time of
the Amenemha and Sesurtesen, we find scribes engaged
in numbering the flocks and ticketing the sacks of corn.
The scribes of the king registered the game obtained
in hunting, the number of hands hewn off after a
victory, and of prisoners, and calculated the amount
of the booty. The temple-scribes are seen in the processions
with pen in hand, and on the monuments the
gods note down the years of the kings on the leaves of
the arbor vit&aelig;. Everything is to be enumerated,
registered, and entered. Even ornaments and utensils
are covered with inscriptions. As the hieroglyphics
on the walls explained the images in the temples,
and the hieroglyphics on the sides of the sepulchral
chambers recorded the race and achievements of eminent
persons and officers, so did the priests write down their
wisdom, and private people their documents on a
lighter material, the leaves of the papyrus, a tall reed
growing in abundance in the swamps of Egypt.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this extensive use, the system of
writing among the Egyptians continued to the end a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
clumsy and difficult system, partly owing to the
number of pictures and symbols, and partly to the
variety of the phonetic pictures. The unchanging
character of the Egyptians, the symbolical and mystic
sense concealed in the hieroglyphics, the religious
character of these old and sacred signs, stood in the
way of the change to a more simple and phonetic mode
of writing. Yet the effort to obtain such a system is
unmistakable. After the year 1300 <small>B.C.</small> a number of
picture symbols were used as phonetic symbols, which
up to that time had no phonetic value, and this change
becomes more and more frequent in the last centuries
<small>B.C.</small> The habit of writing the hieroglyphics on the
papyrus had early led to abbreviation in writing; the
pictures were represented by simple outlines more
adapted to the hand; and hence arose a cursive mode
of writing the hieroglyphics, the so-called "hieratic"
writing, which we already (pp. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>, <a href="#Page_94">94</a>) found in use on
the pyramids under the old kingdom, and which was
in use on an extensive scale at the time when the new
kingdom was at its height. Finally, from the hieratic
writing arose a third and more abbreviated kind, the
demotic, which represented the language of ordinary
intercourse and the national dialect. This was in existence
when Herodotus travelled in Egypt. Here we see
the most marked effort to avoid the ideographic element
and picture signs, and to extend the use of the phonetic
symbols. Beside the remains of the picture symbols,
the demotic writing employs seventeen simple phonetic
symbols and some fifty symbols of syllables. The
hieroglyphic and hieratic modes of writing are called
on the monuments the "writing of the gods," the
demotic is "the writing of the books." For us the
difficulty of the hieroglyphics is materially increased
by the fact that the Coptic language in the form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
accessible to us is removed by thousands of years from
the form of words represented by the hieroglyphics of
the old and new kingdom. The forms which we obtain
from the records preserved in the demotic writing are
about midway between those in the hieroglyphics and
the forms retained in the Coptic translation of the
Scriptures, and in some books of liturgies, which
belong to the first centuries <small>A.D.</small><a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>In the circles of the priests the traditional invocations
of the gods, the rules for the proper conduct
of sacrifices and feasts, for the pure conversation
which is the way to life and salvation in this
world and the next, were without doubt committed
to writing at a very early period. When gradually
extended and continued, those writings grew into a
liturgical canon and ecclesiastical codex of religious
and moral law, and a comprehensive collection of all
the wisdom known to the priests. We learn that the
Egyptian priests possessed forty-two sacred books.
Regarded as a collection of religious rules in every
department of civilisation and life, as the measure of
holy and upright conversation, and as rules of civil
law, these books passed as the writings of the god
Thoth, the scribe of heaven, the god of truth and
justice. The civil law also was grounded upon the
rules and axioms of religion; from these it arose, and
the books of civil law without doubt formed a part of
the sacred law, and of the books of the priests. Of
these forty-two books ten belonged to the high priest,
of which eight may have been the eight books of
civil law (<a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>). In that case the two others would
contain the doctrine concerning the gods, and the
instruction of the priests. Ten other books belonged
to the temple-scribe. Of these the first contained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
rules for the sacred writing; the second the geography
and cosmogony; the third and fourth the arrangement
of the sun, moon, and five planets; the fifth and
sixth the description of Egypt and the Nile; the
seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, the weights and
measures, the mode of registering the temple furniture
and property. Again, ten books belonged to the
chamberlain. These taught the ritual and the liturgy,
the offering of first-fruits and sacrifices, hymns and
prayers, together with the conduct of festivals and
other things of the kind, and, finally, discipline and
the rules for examining the animals for sacrifices.
The two books of the minstrel contained the hymns
and the contemplation of the life proper for a king
(<a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>). The four books of the astrologer concluded
the narrower circle of the sacred writings. Of these,
the first contained the arrangement of the fixed stars;
the second and third the coincidences of the orbits of
the sun and moon; the fourth, the rising of the constellations.
Besides these sacred books the pastophors
(<a href="#Page_196">p. 196</a>) had six books which taught the principles
and practice of medicine;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> for the art of healing, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
of preserving life, also belonged to the priests. The
medicine of the Egyptians is commended as early as
the Homeric poems (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>). Herodotus assures us
that in Egypt every kind of sickness had a special
physician, and Diodorus states that the art was carried
out strictly according to the written principles, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> no
doubt, according to these six sacred books. A hieratic
papyrus on the subject of medicine has been recently
found at Thebes, which is supposed to belong to the
first centuries of the restoration of the monarchy. A
section of this deals with diseases of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Egyptian physicians were much sought after in the
East (the founder of the Persian kingdom, Cyrus,
procured an oculist from Egypt), until the fame of
the Greek medicine about 500 <small>B.C.</small> threw Egyptian
physicians into the shade.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>In the sacred books of the priests was drawn up
the religious system into which the original conceptions
of the gods were shaped and developed in the circles of
the priests. The gods who passed for the greatest and
mightiest in the various districts out of which Egypt
was made up, the protecting deities of the separate
localities, were here arranged in definite ranks and
classes. And if, nevertheless, considerable differences
can be observed in the teaching of the priests of
Memphis and Thebes, they are sufficiently explained
by the mode in which religion and state were developed
in Egypt, and the rival position of the two great
centres of ecclesiastical life. According to the doctrine
of Memphis the seven highest deities were Ptah, the
creative god of light of the lower country; Ra, the
sun-god of Heliopolis; and Shu (Sosis, <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>), the
deity of the clear air; these three were followed by
the forms belonging to the Osiris circle, on whose
nature rested the moral basis of the life of the
Egyptians; Seb, the father of Osiris; Osiris himself;
then his opposite, Typhon; and lastly, Horus, the
conqueror of Typhon.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The doctrine of Thebes placed
Ammon at the head instead of Ptah, and in the place
of Ra stood the two sun-gods of Upper Egypt, Tum
(Atum, <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>) and Mentu; these were followed by
Shu, and the gods of the Osiris circle. To the seven
or eight great gods was appended a circle of twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
gods, and among these Thoth and Anubis. The
twelve were followed by a number of spirits, genii and
demigods. With this system of gods the doctrine of
the priests was connected. Even from the attributes
of Ptah, Neith, and other deities, it is clear that there
was among the priests a strong tendency to gather up
the divine powers into the forms of Ptah, Tum, Osiris,
and Ra. The teaching of the priests evidently desired
to grasp the connection of life, and attain to a
theogony and a theory of creation. It has been
already pointed out on the authority of documents
belonging to the times of the Amenemha and
Sesurtesen, that the priests in their doctrine were at
pains to discover the unity of the divine spirits, and
to conceive the forms of the gods as manifestations
of one being.  They regarded the animals as the
manifestations of special characteristics of the gods,
and men as ph&aelig;nomena of a divine origin and nature,
who would return to the place whence they came. To
go further and grasp the heart of the system is
impossible in the present condition of our researches.
Conceptions and inferences of the Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian
speculation of the time of the Ptolemies and the first
centuries after Christ cannot be accepted as the true
form of the old Egyptian religion, or as the doctrine
of the priests of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>With the Egyptians, as with other nations, poetry
probably arose out of the invocations of the gods and
hymns of praise and thanksgiving. Religious poetry
had a fixed canon in the books of the minstrels. That
national songs were also in vogue is shown by the
monuments (<a href="#Page_222">p. 222</a>). Diodorus told us above that
the achievements of Sesostris were celebrated in
poetry (<a href="#Page_144">p. 144</a>). The description of a deed of arms
of Ramses II. which he must have regarded as of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
considerable importance has been preserved. The
battle he fought with the Cheta in the fifth year of
his reign (<a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a>), he caused to be represented in the
rock temple at Abu Simbel and in the Ramesseum,
and a description of it is engraved in these temples,
as at Luxor and Beth-el-Walli, and in the walls of
the great temple at Karnak. It is found in still
greater detail in a papyrus of the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
At the end is the observation that the scribe Pentaur
composed it in the seventh year of the reign of
Ramses II. In this poem we are told that the chief of
the Cheta had come with his archers and chariots,
three men on each chariot. North-west of Kadesh
they lay in ambush. The king, urging on his chariot,
pressed into the midst of the miserable Cheta. He
found himself surrounded by 2,500 chariots. "My
bowmen and my chariots have abandoned me, this is
what the king said; none of them is here to fight
beside me. What is the will of my father Ammon?
Is he a father who denies his son? Or have I followed
my own thoughts? Did I not set forth at thy command;
has not thy mouth led my armies, and thy
counsel guided them? Have I not celebrated many
brilliant festivals, and filled thy house with booty?
Thirty thousand bulls I have sacrificed with odorous
herbs and perfumes of all kinds. I have built thee
temples of stone, I bring obelisks from Elephantine,
and cause the everlasting stones to be carried down.
For thee&mdash;the great ships swim upon the sea, to bring
thee the tribute of the nations. Has the like been
done before? Ruin on him who opposes thee: salvation
to him who comprehends thee, Ammon. On
thee I call. I am alone before thee in the midst
of unknown nations. My bowmen and chariots
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>left me when I called; no one heard me when I cried
for help. But I choose Ammon before thousands of
bowmen and millions of chariots. The devices of men
are nothing; Ammon will deliver from them. These
words echoed in Hermonthis. Ra comes to him who
calls upon him. He reaches to thee his hand. He
flies to thee, Ramses Miamun. I am with thee, I am
thy father, the sun, and my hand is with thee. Their
hearts shall waver in their breasts and all their limbs
shall fail. They shall not shoot their arrows; their
lances they shall not be able to hold. The chief of
the Cheta sent princes, the prince of Aratus (Aradus)
and the prince of Kirkamischa (Karchemish). My
charioteer was weak, and a great terror came upon his
limbs. He said, Brave king, hold, and let us save the
breath of our lives. What can we do, noble lord,
Ramses Miamun? Mark what his majesty answered
to his charioteer. Courage! Stablish thine heart, my
charioteer. Like the divine hawk, I will swoop into
their midst, they shall be overthrown and hewn
down into the dust. Ammon were no god if he
glorified not my face before their countless hosts.
The king pressed into the midst of the miserable
Cheta, six times he pressed into their midst. My
bowmen and charioteers came at the hour of evening
from their camp: they found the whole region covered
with dead bathed in their blood. His holiness
answered his army and the captains who had not
fought. Ye did not well to leave me alone in the
midst of the enemies. I have fought, I have beaten
back thousands of enemies, and I was alone. The
horses which drew me were 'Might in Thebes,' and
'Rest in the upper land.' As soon as I am within my
royal gates, I command that they have corn every day
before the god Ra. When the earth again became light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
he began the conflict again; he dashed into the battle
like a bull, which hurls himself upon geese, and with
him the mighty lion beside his horses. Rage inflamed all
his limbs. They were hewn in pieces before his mares.
The chief of the miserable Cheta sent to call upon the
great name of his majesty. Thou art the sun, the god
of both worlds, thou art Sutech the great conqueror,
the son of heaven. Baal is in all thy limbs. Terror is
upon the land of Cheta; thou hast possessed thyself
of their inwards for ever. The slave said, as he spoke
to Pharaoh: Since Ammon has granted to thee that
Egypt and the nation of the Cheta shall be slaves at
thy feet, and Ra has granted thee the dominion over
them, thou canst slay thy slaves; they are in thy
power; we lie bowed to the earth, ready to obey thy
command. O brave king, delight of the warriors,
grant us the breath of our lives! The king summoned
his generals in order to hear the message and write an
answer, and toward midday he took ship. He returned
in peace with his army to Egypt. The whole earth
has subjected itself to his name, and the princes, lying
on the ground, worship his countenance."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Not only certain turns in this description, but
passages in invocations which have come down to
us, show that in expressing themselves, the Egyptians,
in spite of the predominant vein of reflection, were
not without force of imagination, or striking figures,
or largeness and vigour of conception. That they
are not free from bombast, foolish exaggeration, and
incessant repetition, any more, or even so little, as the
other nations of the East, is proved more especially
by the inscriptions in the temples recording the
mighty deeds of the kings. Our knowledge of the
manuscripts does not as yet allow us to pass a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
definite judgment. Yet it is beyond doubt that even
in the centuries immediately preceding the irruption
of the Hyksos, under the Sesurtesen and Amenemha,
they were in possession of a written literature, that
even then the oldest parts of the "Book of the Dead"
were not only in existence, but already commentated
upon, and that after the restoration of the kingdom,
beside the comprehensive books of the priests, and
manuscripts on medicine (<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>), there was
at any rate after the fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small>,
and the reign of Ramses II., a literature of a considerable
extent. There is a second papyrus in
existence by the author of the description of the
battle, of which the title runs, "Beginning of the
Rudiments of the Art of Letter-writing by the Scribe
Pentaur, composed in the 10th year of Ramses II."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
The fifth letter of this collection is addressed by
Ameneman, the head of the keepers of the archives of
the treasure of the king, to Pentaur; it is said that
Pentaur has turned his back on the sacred writings,
and applied himself to agriculture. The farmer has
to fear grubs and rats, sparrows and locusts for his
crops; and thieves too. Implements and horses wear
out. The scribes come and demand the taxes, and
the neighbours are away and busy with the harvest.
On the other hand, the work of the scribe is the
highest of all, and the scribe has no taxes to pay.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
On a third papyrus a hymn, addressed by Ramses III.
to Ammon, is said to have been found.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> A fourth has
the name-shields of Sethos II. (<a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>). It is a composition
by a scribe of the name of Enna, and contains the
story of the fate of two brothers.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>  A fifth papyrus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
which is also attributed to the time of successors of
Ramses II., has preserved a collection of apothegms.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
In a country which placed such importance on
preserving every incident, on enumerating, recording,
and registering everything, care must have been
taken to record the series of the kings. When the
shepherds were driven out, the liberation from foreign
dominion would give a strong impulse toward the
attempt to keep firmly before the eyes the old days
of independent Egypt. At the same time these
attempts must have met with serious hindrances. The
destruction which came upon numerous records and
monuments of those old times, and the want of any
definite &aelig;ra of chronology, made it difficult to obtain
a really correct order of succession, or a historical
picture of the ancient period. The historical truth of
the writings, which, in spite of these difficulties, were
undertaken, as is shown by the monuments mentioned
above, and the Turin papyrus (<a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>), was still more
seriously impaired by the fact that the views of the
priests were governed by the conception that the
course of certain periods was allotted to the world by
the gods, and in these periods the fortunes of Egypt
had reached their fulfilment, and would continue to
reach it. We have already become acquainted with
this Sothis period (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29 ff</a>). From the gods came
life and the world. So the gods were said to have
reigned in person over Egypt, before the kings,
their divine successors, ruled over men. Hence
the priests of Lower Egypt commenced the reign
of the seven great gods with the beginning of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Sothis period. The seven great gods were followed
by the twelve gods of the second rank, Thoth,
Anubis, Chunsu, &amp;c., in reigns of gradually diminishing
length through a certain number of Sothis
periods. According to the scheme still preserved,
Ptah reigned 9,000 years, and the last of the gods
only seventy years, so that on an average each
occupies exactly half a Sothis period, or 730 of our
years. These nineteen gods were followed by
thirty demigods; to each of whom was allotted the
twelfth part of a Sothis period for a reign, so that
the whole period of the reign of the gods takes
up twelve Sothis periods, or 17,520 years. After
this, according to some authorities, began the period
of human rulers; others allotted four Sothis periods,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> 5840 years, to another set of demigods. Then
followed, beginning like the rest with the beginning
of a Sothis period, the rule of human kings. This
Sothis period commenced either in the year 5702
<small>B.C.</small>, or, according to the arrangement of Lepsius,
with the year 4242 <small>B.C.</small> This year, therefore, was the
first of the history of Egypt. To Menes the priests
attached the long list of names in one continuous
series, without in the least regarding whether the
dynasties were contemporaneous or successive, whether
they ruled in Upper or Lower Egypt, over the whole
land, or in certain districts only. If we calculate the
rule of the human kings from the first of the dates
given, the first Sothis period of men came to an end,
according to the canon of Manetho, in 4242 <small>B.C.</small>;
the second in 2782 <small>B.C.</small> The third ended in the time
of Menephta I., in whose reign as a fact the Egyptian
year did again coincide with the natural year.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptians were devoted more than other
nations to the contemplation of the heavens. The
constellations announced to them the approach of
the inundation, its height, and its decline. Moreover,
their religion was to a great extent a worship
of light and the sun, and as they plainly perceived
the influence of the stars on the country in the rise
and fall of the water, the increase and abatement of
the heat, &amp;c., it was natural that they should ascribe to
the constellations and the movements of the heavenly
bodies similar influences on the life and growth, the
happiness and misery, of mankind; and this belief
must in turn have contributed to the assiduous and
accurate observation of the heavens. "If anywhere,"
says Diodorus, "it is in Egypt that the most accurate
observation of the position and movements of the
stars have been made. Of each of these they have
records extending over an incredible series of years,
the courses and positions of the planets also they
have accurately observed, and they can accurately
predict the eclipses of the sun and the moon."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Astronomical pictures are not uncommon on the
monuments belonging to the period after the expulsion
of the Hyksos. Fragments of a calendar of
festivals from the time of Ramses II. are found on
a gateway of the Ramesseum. The outer walls of
the temple at Medinet Habu give a complete calendar
of the festivals from the time of Ramses III.
In the tomb of Sethos I. are pictures and names of
the five divinities of the planets known to the
Egyptians, Mercury, Venus (the star of the Bennu,
p. 69), Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; the same picture
is found on the roof of the astronomical hall in
the Ramesseum at Thebes, and on two pictures in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
tombs of Ramses V. and IX. The painting in the
Ramesseum&mdash;though the circle of 369 cubits, which,
according to Diodorus, was once on the roof of the
Ramesseum (<a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>), is wanting, being removed by
Cambyses&mdash;presents a complete map of the Egyptian
sky. The pictures in the tombs of the two kings
give the rising of the stars at intervals of a fortnight.
In the tomb of Ramses IV. the thirty-six Decan stars
are given together with their deities.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The importance
placed by the Egyptian priests on the knowledge of
the sky is shown not only by the monuments, but
also by the four books of the astrologer, and the
third and fourth books of the temple scribe; and that
their astronomical science was by no means slight is
sufficiently proved by their early establishment of a
solar year of 360, and then of 365 days, and by the
observation and establishment of the Sothis periods.
This fact is confirmed by the lists of the rising of the
stars already mentioned. Yet the astronomical knowledge
of the priests of Egypt cannot be placed beside
that of the Babylonians. Representations of the zodiac
are not found on the monuments till the time of the
Ptolemies,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and Ptolemy, himself an Egyptian, has
preserved for us observations of the Chaldees, but
none made by his own countrymen.  The greater
part of the attention which the priests of Egypt
bestowed upon the heavens was given in the interests
of astrology rather than astronomy. As the months
in the year belonged to certain gods, the first to
Thoth, the third (Athyr) to Hathor, the last to Horus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
so the days of the month had their deities. The first
day belonged to Thoth, the second to Horus, the third
to Osiris, &amp;c.; and lastly, every hour of the day was
allotted to a special influence. From the importance
thus given to the days and hours the astrologers
could foretell the fortune of life; they could ascertain
what issue awaited any enterprise&mdash;whether the day
and hour were favourable or not for this or that occupation
or undertaking. For this object they possessed
tables worked out in extensive detail. For instance,
anyone born on the 14th of Athyr, the day when
Typhon was said to have slain Osiris, had to expect a
violent death; anyone born on the 23rd of Phaophi
was doomed to be killed by a crocodile; and anyone
born on the 27th of the same month, by a serpent.
On the other hand, a child born on the 9th of
Phaophi might look forward to a long life. In the
tables of the hours we find for a given day&mdash;first
hour, Orion is lord of the left elbow; second hour, the
Twins have influence on the left ear; fifth hour, the
Pleiads(?) are sovereign over both chambers of the
heart; tenth hour, the feet of the Swine predominate
over the left eye, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>In the achievement won by Egyptian art the
priests took a leading part. The buildings of the
temples and the tombs of the kings could only be
erected after their designs; for in these essentially
sacred things, sacred measures and numbers, were concerned,
and, like architecture, sculpture and painting
were primarily employed in the service of religion.
As we might expect from the character of the people,
the architecture of the Egyptians aimed at the firm and
durable. The structures rise up simple in their lines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
like the ridges of rock which are the boundaries of
Egypt, broad and massive. The pyramids, with great
simplicity of form, were found to display a considerable
skill in dealing with and uniting large masses of stone.
Following this path, the architecture of Egypt has
always preserved a severity and simplicity of outline
even when employing richer forms and ornaments.
Among the Egyptians sculpture and painting never
attained independence; it was their vocation to
support architecture, and assist her in preserving in
the stream of time the picture of the king, his
sacrifices, and his achievements, and this or that
incident of his reign. The sculpture of the Egyptians
exhibits a vigorous attempt to grasp the forms in a
naive, but prosaic and merely intellectual manner; it
preserves them free from any fanciful use of symbols,
and conceives the human form in fixed proportions
and characteristic expression of movement, while it is
still more happy in the form and character of the
animals. Like architecture, sculpture prefers to work
in the hardest and most lasting material. But, as in
all other departments of life, so here; the type when
once fixed, the canon of proportion when once discovered,
the mode of treatment and the law of form is
rigorously retained. With complete accuracy of execution
in the most difficult material, sculpture constantly
repeats the same figures, geometrical rather than
natural in form. Yet in spite of this typical character,
in sculpture and painting, as in architecture, a considerable
development took place. The statues of the
times of the pyramids, the Amenemha and Sesurtesen,
exhibit, comparatively speaking, very correct forms,
lively energy in the expression of action, and a strong
treatment of the muscles; but the sculptures of the
new kingdom are distinguished by greater variety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of forms, a larger wealth of lines, and a delicacy of
outline; the drawing of the figures is far more slender,
and there is considerable grace in the treatment of
massive pillars and capitals. The Tuthmosis and
Amenophis, the Sethos, and the earliest Ramses, imposed
upon Egyptian art an almost oppressive number
of tasks, and in performing them she touched
her highest point. But the amount of work must of
itself have introduced a more and more conventional
treatment within the limits of the typical circle in
which sculpture moved; and at last this treatment
was content with mere precision of outlines. This
is the character of the sculpture of the times of
Ramses III. down to the days of Psammetichus, in
which, by a truer imitation of nature, and greater
grace in the form of the bodies, it once more attained
to a beautiful after-growth.</p>

<p>The industry and skill with which the cultivation
of the land and of the vine, and the breeding of
cattle and sheep, was carried on in Egypt even before
the invasion of the Hyksos, has been already seen on
the monuments of the time of the Sesurtesen and
Amenemha (<a href="#Page_118">p. 118</a>). The fields were tilled with ploughs
drawn by oxen, or with the hoe. It was not in every
case necessary to make furrows. In December and
January, when the water had run off, the seed was
cast into the moist ground and trodden in, as we see
from the monuments, by sheep and goats. Everywhere
the overseer is in the field with the labourers
and herdmen. By the end of March harvest was
ready; wheat and maize were cut with the sickle, and
then the grain was trodden out by oxen. Meanwhile
the thrasher sang, according to the inscription on a
rock tomb at El Kab (above Thebes), "Thrash for
yourselves, oxen, thrash for yourselves; thrash bushels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
for your masters."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Diodorus remarks that it was
marvellous with what care and skill the herds were
tended by their keepers in Egypt, what knowledge
of healing plants and of food was to be found in
these keepers, how their occupation came to them
from their forefathers, with a large stock of experience
and manual skill; and how their knowledge
increased to an incredible degree the propagation of the
animals.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> On the monuments we find not only great
herds of cattle, asses, sheep, and goats, but also whole
droves of hens, ducks, and geese. Poultry-sellers and
depots of poultry are often found. These sculptures
confirm the statements of Diodorus of the careful
tending of the animals; they also show us the medicinal
treatment of ailing animals. Beside this wealth
of cattle, there was an abundance of fish, provided
by the Nile. These were caught partly with hooks,
and partly with large nets. The upper classes fished
for pleasure. Yet most kinds of fish were forbidden
food: the priests, as we have seen, were not allowed
to taste fish at all.</p>

<p>The monuments also teach us that hunting was
not neglected by the Egyptians. Hares, foxes,
antelopes, gazelles, hy&aelig;nas, buffaloes, and lions were
driven into inclosures surrounded by nets, or chased
with the bow and arrow and dogs, or with the chariot
and hounds. Gazelles and buffaloes were also taken
with the lasso; traps were set for the hy&aelig;nas; the
hippopotamus was attacked with a spear from a
boat.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Of the industry of the Egyptians in trade we have
already had striking evidence in the monuments of the
old kingdom. There we saw all kinds of manufactures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
in the various stages; we found on them the simple
weaver's loom, which produced the robes of byssus, so
highly valued in antiquity,&mdash;the lasting fabric which
may still be examined in the clothing of mummies.
The early development of technical skill meets us more
especially in the pictures of the preparation of glass on
the tombs at Beni Hassan. Glass cups and vessels are
frequently found in the tombs, and Strabo observes
that the earth required for making glass is among
the products of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The working of the copper
mines in the mountains of Sinai goes considerably
further back than the date of the tombs at Beni
Hassan. They were open as early as the times of
Snefru and Chufu.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Yet by far the greatest proportion
of hands must have been employed upon the
buildings of the kings and the tombs of the wealthy.
On the monuments we see the masons in all their
various occupations; painters and statuaries also are
represented there in the different moments of their
work; and the tables of proportion which they
followed are still preserved.</p>

<p>Even before the invasion of the Hyksos, as we saw
from the tombs at Beni Hassan, the life of the wealthy
Egyptian was surrounded by considerable elegance (<a href="#Page_118">p.
118</a>). The houses of the rich, built, according to the
pictures on the monuments, in a light and graceful
style, in contrast to the heavy structure of the temples,
had several stories, and were provided with the galleries
and terraces still usual in the East. Houses in the
country had shady avenues of trees, planted in exact
rows, and neat beds of flowers, graceful pavilions, and
fountains of water. The common national dress was a
linen shirt, and over it a woollen cloak; the labourer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and the lowest class had only an apron round the body;
but the clothing of the higher classes was choice and
delicate. The women, who enjoyed considerable freedom
in Egypt, wore various ornaments&mdash;necklaces,
eardrops, and bracelets; rings of the most various
shape adorned almost every finger. Their hair was
carefully dressed; they bathed frequently, and made
a considerable use of ointments. Life was sociable in
ancient Egypt. In the tombs at Beni Hassan we find
men carried in a palanquin to a social meeting; and
in the tombs at Thebes they are driving in chariots
to a similar gathering. Gaily-dressed men and women
meet and converse with each other in the hall; slaves,
light-coloured and black, in part handsomely-dressed,
hand them garlands and cups. The table is spread.
Bread, figs, and grapes are set out in baskets, wine
in glass bottles; vegetables and poultry are also there.
The solid food was eaten with the hand, liquids were
taken with spoons. At these banquets the Egyptians
do not seem to have been very moderate. Herodotus
tells us that a small wooden image of a mummy was
carried round at their entertainments, with the exhortation,
"Look on this, drink and be merry. When
dead, thou wilt be as this is!"<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> This admonition was
not without its results. In the pictures on monuments
we find not only men, but women, throwing up the
surfeit of food and wine; others are carried away
home by their servants. Indeed, excess and drunkenness
are quoted among the forty-two chief sins of the
Egyptians. During the meal dancers were introduced,
and bands of musicians, male and female, who
played on harps, guitars, and flutes; among which was
mingled the sound of the tambourine. A chorus also
sang to the harp.  The company also played and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
danced.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> We have already seen that games of ball
and mora were played under the old monarchy.
Among the recreations of the new monarchy draughts
are found. We often find on the monuments
sketches of men and women who exhibit contortions
of their bodies and feats of strength. Sham-fights
at sea also occur, and wrestling matches are very
common.</p>

<p>Proudly as the Egyptians, in the consciousness of
their purity and culture, looked down on "the
unclean and perverse" nations outside their land,
and rarely as they travelled into other countries, Egypt
was nevertheless the centre of a considerable trade.
China and Japan also for a long time shut themselves
up from the outer world, yet their trade was considerable,
though permitted only at certain fixed places. The
Egyptians also caused the products which they needed
to be brought, without themselves going to seek them.
Egypt required wood for the building of houses and
ships, brass, ivory, slaves, and incense. Even before
the year 1500 <small>B.C.</small>, Arabian caravans carried the
products of the south coast of Arabia to Syria and
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The wandering tribes of Libya, Syria, and
Arabia required corn, weapons, utensils, and implements,
which they could buy in Egypt. Then at a
later period came the trade of the Phenicians with
Egypt. They could bring wood from the forests of
Lebanon&mdash;wine, oil, slaves, amber, and tin, and exchange
them for the manufactures of Egypt; for retail
goods, glass, drugs, which Egypt produced in great
quantities, fish, Egyptian fabrics, linen, and material
prepared from the papyrus. The Greeks called fabrics
made from this plant, "byblian," from the city Byblus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a proof that they first became acquainted with these
Egyptian wares through the Phenicians, and mainly
through the ships of Byblus, and received them from
this quarter. Horses, also, and chariots were brought
as articles of trade from Egypt to Syria about the
year 1000 <small>B.C.</small>; at that time a chariot cost in Egypt
600 shekels, and a horse 150.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> So far as we can
gather from the legends of the Greeks, the trading
ships could only enter the Canopic mouth of the Nile,
and intercourse with foreign merchants could only
take place on the little island of Pharos, opposite
the city of Thonis. Here the mariners of that day,
the Phenicians, and with them, and after them, the
Ionians, carried on their trade with the Egyptians.
On land the only entrance was by Pelusium; and here
as also at Pharos, an entrance-tax had apparently to
be paid. From the Homeric poems we may conclude
that there was then a trade with Egypt, and not only
piratical descents upon the coasts; but when the
Ionians, about the middle of the eighth century, began
to enter into dangerous competition with the Phenicians,
the latter seem to have succeeded in getting
the Greeks excluded from Egypt, and obtaining for
themselves the monopoly of the sea&mdash;a privilege
which, however, they did not maintain for more than
a century.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Such was ancient Egypt, the land of marvel, whose
richly developed civilization lies on the threshold of
historical life. Excellently furnished by nature, and
placed in a peculiarly favoured land, the Copts have
transferred to their own lives and civilization the grave
and solemn character of their sky and their country.
Their conservative feeling is directed towards fixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and unalterable order; the sons repeat the lives of
their fathers, and the nation is divided into various
classes and corporations, which carry on the same
occupations from generation to generation. The beneficent
powers of nature, the mystery of life, the life
returning out of death&mdash;these are the forces and laws
which the Egyptians worshipped as their good gods,
whose creation is the fruitful world, who manifest
themselves in good creatures, whose unchangeable
nature they seemed to recognise as embodied in the
instinctive and unalterable life of certain animals.
The life of the nation adapts itself also to priestly
rules, which operate without alteration, like the laws
of nature.</p>

<p>As the heart of this people was set upon the continuance
of the race and occupation, on rule and law,
so also was it their desire to prolong the existence of the
individual. This impulse towards the preservation of
self operated so strongly that the Egyptians busied
themselves with the future quite as much as with
the past. It was this trait in their character which
caused the Egyptians to rescue their dead from
corruption, and occupied the living with the construction
of "eternal dwellings for the dead." This it
was which made them a nation of scribes, builders,
painters and sculptors. These efforts culminate in
the buildings of the kings, who could command the
whole powers of the land in preserving their names.
The Egyptians were loath to end with death. It was
the true vocation of every man worthily to build and
"adorn his tomb;" and the essential object of life is&mdash;not
to lose the everlasting life after death by unclean
and unlawful conversation&mdash;to win a return to the
divine origin of life.</p>

<p>With the simple confidence of childhood, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
patient endurance of a man, and with iron perseverance,
the Egyptians attempted to redeem the existence
of man from destruction and decay, and rescue his life
from oblivion. The power of the Egyptians exhausted
itself in this toil after continuance of life. But
however eager a man might be to preserve his own
individuality, he loses it in the presence of his
ruler, who gathers up in his own person the whole
political life of the nation, and exhausts it. Like a
god, or an incarnate Destiny, the Pharaoh stands in
absolute supremacy over the land; "His countenance
beams over Egypt as the sun;" before him all distinctions
fade away, and all bow down in equal obedience.
But even though the perishable was preserved, and
made as lasting as the rocks of the land&mdash;though in
the ceremonial, the ritual, and the rules of life the
same unalterable constancy prevailed as in the laws of
nature, there was still room beside fixed prescription
and the will of the divine ruler for the vigorous
pursuit of an industry which was not far behind that
of modern Europe, for an enjoyment of life in the
Oriental manner, which was not only social, but even
luxurious and sensual.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Egyptians to preserve themselves
and their actions, and to cause their names to live in
the mouths of the generations after them, have not been
without a result. What the Greeks and Romans knew
of their history were traditions attached to the great
monuments. Before our researches the Egyptian
nation has literally risen from the tomb; the pyramids
tell us the history of the old monarchy, and the
temples at Thebes the history of the new. Without
these monuments the kings of Manetho would have
remained an empty and unintelligible echo. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
mountains of stone at the threshold of history, these
chronicles of hieroglyphics, this nation of mummies
proclaim, beyond contradiction, that nations do succeed
in outliving themselves by their works, but
also that their life reaches only so far as their
development.</p>

temple an image is to be set up to the "god Epiphanes, the avenger of Egypt,"
to whom the principal deity of the temple presents the arms of victory.
Three times in every day the image of Epiphanes is to be worshipped, and
on the great festivals the same honours are to be paid to him as to the
rest of the gods. In addition, a special festival is solemnized every year
to the god Epiphanes, and a special order of priests established for him.
This resolution of the collected priests was ordered to be engraved on
hard stone and set up in all the temples of the first, second, and third
class. The full title of Epiphanes is: "Son of Ptah, Beloved of Ammon
and Ra, the Child of the Sun, the Eternal."</p></div>

astounding that it can hardly have been part of any plan of the priests; the
whole history of Egypt contradicts an elective monarchy of such a kind.
These supposed elections were said to have taken place on the Libyan
mountains, near Thebes; the priests mentioned the names of the candidates
for whom the votes were to be given. The votes of the prophets
had the value of one hundred, those of the lower priests of twenty, of the
servants of the temple of ten, and of the warrior class of one.</p></div>

of a fifth belonged to them in a certain sense. We have tolerably ancient
records on papyrus, on which are given the incomes of the temples, with
the names of the tax-payers, and the things given in taxation. When the
Ptolemies ruled over Egypt the land which paid to the temples belonged
actually to the temples as property, but as property revocable at will, and
the kings on their side taxed the temples just as the Islamite princes are
accustomed to tax their mosques. In the Rosetta inscription, under date
March 27, 196 <small>B.C.</small>, the prophets, upper priests, chamberlains, pastophors,
and scribes, explain that the king (Ptolemy Epiphanes) had given an
order that the incomes of the temples and the land-taxes paid to them
yearly, and the portions reserved for the gods in the vineyards and other
property, should continue to be paid. At the same time we see from the
sequel of this inscription, as well as from other sources, that these incomes
were not sufficient to keep the temples in good order, and the king was
compelled to make additions. Yet, in any case, the Ptolemies by their
state taxes withdrew from the temples a portion of their incomes. From
every plot of corn-land (&#7940;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#945;) the temples were to pay to the king an
<i>artabe</i> of corn, and from every plot of vineyard an amphora of wine. Besides
this, they had to pay a money-tax and a certain amount of byssus cloth.</p></div>

tells us that the swineherds married in their own order only, it follows
that the other orders married with each other. The attempt has often
been made to explain the so-called divisions of the Egyptians into castes by
the immigration of foreign tribes. This conception places in mechanical
layers what is really an organic development. In India such an assumption
has a certain historical foundation. There, there was a servile class (the
Sudra) under three superior classes; the first was composed of the original
inhabitants, the others of the Aryan immigrants. This kind of division
is wholly wanting in Egypt, and not less so any historical or physiological
foundation for the immigrations. Strabo knows three orders only in
Egypt; the priests, the soldiers, and the population engaged in work or
trades. Diodorus (1, 74) speaks of five orders; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in addition to the
first two, husbandmen, artizans, and shepherds. Plato ("Tim&aelig;us," p. 21)
mentions priests, soldiers, artizans, shepherds, and hunters; Herodotus
mentions priests, warriors, cowherds, swineherds, merchants, interpreters,
and mariners. In Plato and Diodorus we miss the merchants, who
certainly were not wanting in Egypt, and in Herodotus the husbandmen
and artizans. Nothing therefore remains but the natural assumption
that the labouring masses were chiefly divided into shepherds, artizans,
and husbandmen; and these were again broken into many divisions
according to their different vocations, and each of our authorities has
brought into prominence those distinctions which especially came under his
notice. As Herodotus especially notices cowherds, we must suppose that
those herdsmen are probably meant who derived a living from the buffalo
herds, which they pastured in the swampy flats of the Delta, on the
border of Egypt, and lived in huts of reeds.&mdash;Diod. 1, 43.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_274_274" id="Footnote_274_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_274_274"><span class="label">[274]</span></a> The number of provinces in Egypt under the old kingdom appears to
have been twenty-seven, according to the myth of the hewing of the body
of Osiris into twenty-seven pieces, and the distribution of them to all the
priests of the land for burial, which Diodorus has preserved. From this
may be derived the number of twenty-seven courts in the labyrinth given by
Strabo, p. 811, and twenty-five in Pliny, pp. 113, 114; as a fact the building
had only twelve courts. Yet Strabo mentions thirty-six provinces (p. 787).
Later coins give forty-six provinces, and Ptolemy forty-seven. Forty-four
nomes, twenty-two for Upper Egypt and as many for Lower Egypt,
can be established, together with their names.&mdash;Brugsch, "Hist. d'Egypte,"

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF BABYLON.</h3>


<p>The neighbours of Egypt on the east were the Syrians
and Arabians. Herodotus gives the name of Syrians
to the inhabitants of the Syrian coasts and Mount
Lebanon, the settlers on the Euphrates and Tigris,
and the population of the eastern districts of Asia
Minor. In Xenophon the Babylonians speak Syriac.
Strabo remarks that the Syrians and Arabians are
closely related in language, mode of life, and physique&mdash;that
Syrians dwelt on both sides of the Taurus&mdash;that
the same language was spoken on both sides of
the Euphrates&mdash;that Babylon and Nineveh were cities
of the Syrians&mdash;that the Assyrian kingdom was a
kingdom of Syrians, and that the inhabitants of the
kingdom of Babylon and Nineveh were called Syrians
by their own historians.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> As a fact tribes closely
related in language and nature&mdash;which we denote by
the general term Semitic&mdash;invaded with their armies
the broad steppes of Arabia, and the Syrian desert,
occupied the coasts of Syria and a part of Asia Minor,
and inhabited the district of the Euphrates and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Tigris, from the mountains of Armenia to the Persian
Gulf on the south, and the tableland of Iran on the
east. The languages of the Arabians, the Semitic tribes
of the south, the Aram&aelig;ans and Canaanites in the west,
and the Babylonians and Assyrians in the east, are
three ramifications springing from one and the same
stem of language, which spreads from the Black Sea and
the Mediterranean to the Arabian and Persian Gulfs.
Living under different conditions, the Semitic nations
attained to different degrees of civilization. The tribes
of the desert did not go beyond the simplest and
most primitive forms, at which point a considerable
portion of them still remain; but the inhabitants of
more favoured districts developed independently, and
in the course of time these developments operated on
each other, and thus led to a far more varied, and, in
certain directions, far more vigorous culture, than the
isolated, exclusive, and self-concentrated civilization of
Egypt.</p>

<p>The two rivers which determine the character and
nature of the depression between the Syrian plateau
and the tableland of Iran rise at no great distance
from each other on the mountains of Armenia. The
Euphrates rises to the north, the Tigris to the south.
After leaving the mountains of Armenia&mdash;the
Euphrates, by a broad circuit to the west, the Tigris
by a direct course to the south&mdash;both rivers enter a
tolerably lofty steppe, where the uniform surface is
broken by ridges of rock, by ranges of hills, pastures,
and fruitful strips of land, while the banks of the
rivers are overgrown with forests of plane-trees,
tamarisks, and cypresses, and shut in by meadows.
As the soil becomes more level, these fruitful depressions
by the rivers become somewhat broader, but the
land between the streams becomes more sterile and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
treeless, and supports only nomad tribes and herds
of wild asses, ostriches, and bustards.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> When the
Euphrates has left behind the last spurs of this
desolate hill country, at the place where the two
rivers approach each other most nearly&mdash;about 400
miles from their mouths&mdash;there commences a plain
of brown rich soil. Through this the Euphrates
passes with a quiet stream, but the Tigris hurries to
the sea down a bed which is both narrower, and often
inclosed by rocks, while at the same time the river
is increased by copious additions from the western
edge of the tableland of Iran. In spite of the
excellent soil this flat would remain unfruitful unless
the two rivers, year by year, when the snow melted on
the Armenian mountains, overflowed their banks, and
thus irrigated the land for the summer. In the Tigris
the inundation commences about the beginning of
June, in the Euphrates, whose sources lie far higher,
about the beginning of July. But this inundation
does not take place nearly so calmly and regularly as
that in the Nile. Instead of fertilising water, the
Tigris often sends down destructive floods over the
plain, and changes it, down to the marshy Delta at
the mouth, into a broad and rolling sea.</p>

<p>By its simple structure and the absence of any
internal limitations, this low-lying land on the
Euphrates and Tigris was favourable to the development
of great kingdoms, and was hardly behind the
Nile in incentives and instigations to a civilised life.
The writers of antiquity celebrate the fruitfulness and
natural wealth of these flats. While on the other
side of the Euphrates, so writes a Babylonian historian
of his own home, the land as far as Arabia is without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>water and fruits, and on the other side of the Tigris
the land is indeed fruitful but rocky; in the land
between the streams wheat and barley, linseed beans
and sesame grow wild; both in the marshes and the
reeds of the river nourishing roots are found in abundance,
as valuable for food as barley. Besides these
there are dates, and apples, and other different fruits,
and abundance of fish and birds in the marsh and on the
land. Herodotus commends the wealth of the land
in wheat and palms in the strongest terms; Xenophon
speaks in admiration of the size and beauty of the
dates.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Even now the palm-forests which run without
interruption along the lower course of both rivers
produce dates in abundance, and with their slender
forms and lofty tops give a picturesqueness to the
otherwise uniform landscape. This vigorous vegetation,
together with the peculiar character of the
land, must have early incited a capable population to
a regular cultivation and a higher civilization. The
protection of the land against the rapid overflow, the
conducting of the water to the higher districts, and the
removal of water from the marshes, must have led to
measures calculated to produce and develop a fertility
of technical resources. Basins were required of more
considerable extent, longer canals, and stronger dams
against the violent inundations, and more extensive
conduits, in order to convey the water into the middle
of the land, than were necessary in Egypt. Long
before Egypt had reached the height of her power
and prosperity under the Tuthmosis and Amenophis
and the early Ramessids, the inhabitants of this plain
had attained to a peculiar culture and civilisation.</p>

<p>The accounts which the Greeks have handed down
to us of the fortunes of these districts in ancient times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
are meagre and defective. The power of the Semitic
empires on the Euphrates and Tigris had fallen long
before inquisitive Greeks penetrated the East, and the
Persians, who were the rulers at that time, had little
interest in instructing the Greeks in the former
splendour of their opponents and ancient masters.
Herodotus intended to write the history of the
Assyrians; if ever composed, it has not come down
to our times. On the other hand, he has described
the land, manners, and customs of the Babylonians;
of their history, however, he only tells us that
many kings and two queens ruled over Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
Aristotle remarks that in Babylon astronomical
observations were said to exist extending back 31,000
years from the time of Alexander the Great.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
Diodorus tells us that the priests of Babylon declared
that they had observed the heavens for 473,000
years. Cicero speaks of the shamelessness of the
Chald&aelig;ans in boasting that they possessed records for
more than 470,000 years. Julius Africanus gives
480,000 years, and Pliny even 720,000 years as the
period for which observations of the heavens burnt
upon tiles were in existence.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>About the time when Manetho compiled his list of
Egyptian sovereigns, under the rule of Antiochus Soter
(281-262 <small>B.C.</small>) Berosus, a priest of the temple of Bel at
Babylon, composed a history of his country in Greek
in three books.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Only a few fragments of this work
have come down to us. Berosus commenced with
the creation of the world. "Once all was darkness
and water. In this chaos lived horrid animals, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
men with two wings, and others with four wings and
two faces, and others again with double organs male
and female. Others had the thighs of goats, and
horns on their heads; others had horses' feet, or were
formed behind like a horse and in front like a man.
There were bulls with human heads, and horses and
men with the heads of dogs, and other animals of
human shape with fins like fishes, and fishes like
sirens, and dragons, and creeping things, and serpents
and wild creatures, the images of which are to be
found in the temple of Bel. Over all these ruled a
woman of the name of Omorka. But Bel divided the
darkness and clove the woman asunder, and of one
part he made the earth, and of the other the sun and
moon and planets, and he drew off the water,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and
apportioned it to the land, and prepared and arranged
the world. But those creatures could not endure the
light of the sun, and became extinct. When Bel saw
the land uninhabited and fruitful, he smote off his
head and bade one of the gods mingle the blood
which flowed from his head with earth, and form therewith
men and animals and wild creatures, who could
support the atmosphere. A great multitude of men
of various tribes inhabited Chald&aelig;a, but they lived
without any order, like the animals. Then there
appeared to them from the sea, on the shore of
Babylonia, a fearful animal of the name of Oan. Its
body was that of a fish, but under the fish's head
another head was attached, and on the fins were feet
like those of a man, and it had a man's voice. Its
image is still preserved. The animal came at morning
and passed the day with men. But it took no
nourishment, and at sunset went again into the sea,
and there remained for the night. This animal taught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
men language and science, the harvesting of seeds
and fruits, the rules for the boundaries of land, the
mode of building cities and temples, arts and writing,
and all that pertains to the civilisation of human
life."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>The first sovereign of Babylon was Alorus, a
Chald&aelig;an of the city of Babylon, whom the god had
himself pointed out to the nation as a shepherd. His
reign continued for 36,000 years. After the death of
Alorus, his son Alaparus ruled for 10,800 years. He
was succeeded by Almelon from the Chald&aelig;ans, of the
city of Sippara, for 46,800 years, and Almelon by
Ammenon, a Chald&aelig;an of the same city for 43,200
years. Under his rule there came out of the sea an
animal, combining, like Oan, the shape of a fish and
a man, and called Idotion.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> After Ammenon came
Amegalarus, of the city of Sippara, for 64,800 years,
and after him Daonus, also from Sippara, for 36,000
years. In his reign there again appeared from the
Red Sea four animals in the shape of men and fish.
These were Euedokus, Eneugamus, Eneubulus, and
Anementus. Daonus was followed by Edorankhus, from
Sippara, who ruled for 64,800 years, and in his time
appeared another monster of the same kind, named
Odakon. These explained in detail what Oan had
given in the sum. After Edorankhus came Amempsinus,
a Chald&aelig;an of Larancha for 36,000 years,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and
after him Otiartes (Ubaratulu),<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> a Chald&aelig;an of the
same city for 28,000 years. Otiartes was followed
by his son Xisuthrus who reigned 64,800 years.</p>

<p>From the first year of Alorus to the last year of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Xisuthrus 432,000 years had elapsed. "In this year
the god Bel revealed to Xisuthrus in a dream that
in the fifteenth year of the month Da&euml;sius there
would be a great storm of rain, and men would be
destroyed by the flood of waters. He bade him bury
all written records, the ancient, medi&aelig;val, and modern,
in Sippara, the city of the sun, and build a ship and
embark in it with his kindred and nearest friends.
He was also to take food and drink into the ship,
and carry into it all creatures winged and four-footed.
Xisuthrus did as he was bidden, and built a
boat fifteen stadia long,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and two stadia in breadth, and
placed in it his wife and child, his relations and friends.
Then the inundation came. When the rain ceased,
Xisuthrus sent out some birds, but they returned back
to the ship, as they could find nothing to eat and no
place of rest. After a few days he sent out other birds.
These also returned, but with mud on their feet. Then
Xisuthrus sent yet others, and they never returned.
Xisuthrus knew that the earth had appeared. He
took out a part of the roof of his boat, and perceived
that it had settled down on a mountain. Then
he went out with his wife and daughter and the
architect of the boat. He worshipped the earth,
and built an altar, offered sacrifice to the gods, and
then disappeared together with those whom he had
brought out of the boat. When his companions,
whom he had left in the boat, had gone out,
and were in search of Xisuthrus, his voice called
to them out of the air, saying that the gods had
carried him away in reward for his piety; that he
with his daughter and the architect were dwelling
among the gods. But the others were to return from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Armenia, where they then were, to Babylon, and, in
obedience to the command of the gods, dig up the
books buried at Sippara, and give them to mankind.
They obeyed these instructions. They sacrificed to
the gods, and returned by land to Babylon. They dug
up the sacred books, erected many cities and temples,
and rebuilt Babylon. On the Gordy&aelig;an mountains,
where it settled, remains of the boat of Xisuthrus
were in existence for a long time afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> In
Lucian Xisuthrus is called Sisythes; and he with
wives and children is said to have escaped, in the
great ark, the flood which destroyed everything
else.</p>

<p>After the flood Euexius reigned over the land of the
Chald&aelig;ans for 2,400 years. He was followed by his
son Chomasbelus, who reigned 2,700 years; and after
him came eighty-four kings, who, if we reckon in the
reigns of Euexius and Chomasbelus, ruled for 34,080
years.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Then the Medes gathered together an army
against Babylon, and took the land, and set up tyrants
from among their own people. These, eight in number,
reigned over Babylon for 234 years. After that eleven
kings reigned for 248 years; then followed the Chald&aelig;ans,
with forty-nine kings, who ruled over Babylon
for 458 years. These were followed by nine Arabian
kings for 245 years, and then came forty-five Assyrian
kings for 526 years. These were followed by Sennacherib,
Asordan, Samuges, and his brother, and
afterwards by Nabopolassar. After Nabopolassar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Nabukudurussar (Nebuchadnezzar) and his successor
reigned for sixty-seven years.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Such is the essential information contained in the
fragments of Berosus which have come down to us.
They give us a tolerably clear view of the system of
cosmogony set up by the priests of Babylon, of the
way in which order and civilisation arose among men
by successive revelations from divine creatures coming
out of the sea, and a sketch, though a very meagre one,
of the dynasties which reigned over Babylon down to
the time of Cyrus. The enormous number of 432,000
years, which the fragments allot to the ten rulers of
the first dynasty, and the 34,080 years of the second
dynasty, which came immediately after the flood,
show that the statements of Diodorus, Cicero, and
Pliny are not mere imagination, though these totals
are perhaps scarcely intended to give the period
during which observations were made by the Chald&aelig;ans,
but the antiquity ascribed by the Babylonian
priests to the existence of the world before and after
the flood.</p>

<p>Accounts of the great flood are also to be seen on
tablets, copied from old Babylonian originals, which
have been discovered in the ruins of the palace of Assurbanipal,
king of Assyria. Disregarding the strange beginning,
and still stranger close, we find on these tablets
that the god Hea had commanded Sisit (Xisuthrus)
of Surippak to build a ship, so many cubits in length,
breadth, and height, and to launch it on the deep,
for it was his intention to destroy sinners. "When
the flood comes, which I will send, thou shalt enter
into the ship, and into the midst of it thou shalt
bring thy corn, thy goods, thy gods, thy gold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
silver, thy slaves male and female, the sons of the
army, the wild and tame animals, and all that thou
hearest thou shalt do." Sisit found it difficult to
carry out this command, but at last he yielded, and
gathered together all his possessions of silver and gold,
all that he had of the seeds of life, and caused all
his slaves, male and female, to go into the ship. The
wild and tame beasts of the field also he caused to
enter, and all the sons of the army. "And Samas
(the god of the sun) made a flood, and said: I will
cause rain to fall heavily from heaven; go into the
ship, and shut to the door. Overcome with fear,
Sisit entered into the ship, and on the morning of
the day fixed by Samas the storm began to blow from
the ends of heaven, and Bin thundered in the midst
of heaven, and Nebo came forth, and over the mountains
and plains came the gods, and Nergal, the
destroyer, overthrew, and Adar came forth and dashed
down: the gods made ruin; in their brightness they
swept over the earth. The storm went over the nations;
the flood of Bin reached up to heaven; brother did not
see brother; the lightsome earth became a desert, and
the flood destroyed all living things from the face of
the earth. Even the gods were afraid of the storm,
and sought refuge in the heaven of Anu; like hounds
drawing in their tails, the gods seated themselves on
their thrones, and Istar the great goddess spake. The
world has turned to sin, and therefore I have proclaimed
destruction, but I have begotten men, and
now they fill the sea, like the children of fishes. And
the gods upon their seats wept with her. On the
seventh day the storm abated, which had destroyed
like an earthquake, and the sea began to be dry. Sisit
perceived the movement of the sea. Like reeds floated
the corpses of the evil-doers and all who had turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
to sin. Then Sisit opened the window, and the light
fell upon his face, and the ship was stayed upon
Mount Nizir, and could not pass over it. Then on
the seventh day Sisit sent forth a dove, but she
found no place of rest, and returned. Then he sent
a swallow, which also returned, and again a raven,
which saw the corpses in the water, and ate them, and
returned no more. Then Sisit released the beasts to
the four winds of heaven, and poured a libation and
built an altar on the top of the mountain, and cut seven
herbs, and the sweet savour of the sacrifice caused the
gods to assemble, and Sisit prayed that Bel (El)
might not come to the altar. For Bel (El) had made
the storm and sunk the people in the deep, and wished
in his anger to destroy the ship and allow no man to
escape. Adar opened his mouth and spoke to the
warrior Bel (El): Who would then be left? And
Hea spoke to him: Captain of the gods, instead of
the storm, let lions and leopards increase, and diminish
mankind; let famine and pestilence desolate the land
and destroy mankind. When the sentence of the
gods was passed, Bel (El) came into the midst of the
ship and took Sisit by the hand and conducted him
forth, and caused his wife to be brought to his side,
and purified the earth, and made a covenant, and
Sisit and his wife and his people were carried away
like gods, and Sisit dwelt in a distant land at the
mouth of the rivers."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The correspondence to the Hebrew tradition of
the flood, the coincidence of certain points, and
striking contrast of others, both in the narrative of
Berosus and in this account of the great flood, need
not be pointed out. In number, at any rate, the ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
kings whom Berosus places before the flood correspond
to the ten patriarchs from Adam to Noah.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In
Berosus the boat of Xisuthrus lands in Armenia on
the mountains of the Gordy&aelig;ans; Noah's ark landed
on the mountains of the land of Ararat. Like Sisit,
Xisuthrus builds an altar and offers sacrifice; when he
has left the boat he disappears, and bids his followers
return to Chald&aelig;a. They obey, and rebuild Babylon.
Noah, after leaving the ark, builds an altar to the Lord
and offers burnt sacrifice, and concludes the new covenant
with Jehovah. Then Noah became a husbandman,
and lived for three hundred and fifty years after the
flood; but when the generations of his sons "journeyed
from the East, they found a plain in the land of Shinar,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in Babylonia, and there they dwelt and built the
city called Babylon."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> It is clear that these legends
formed an ancient common possession of the Semitic
tribes of the lands of the Euphrates and Tigris. In
the Scriptures of the Hebrews we find this in a purified
and deepened form. The reason for the legend of the
flood is found in the nature of the land of Babylon.
As has been remarked, it is inundated yearly; it is
also occasionally desolated by fierce floods, which change
the whole of the lower land as far as the sea into a
broad sheet of water. Similar legends are found in
all regions exposed to floods, in Armenia, Thessaly,
B&#339;otia, and in India.</p>

<p>Let us now attempt to ascertain what may be
gained historically from the fragments of Berosus.
The seven Fish-men rise out of the sea of Babylonia,
i.e., out of the Persian Gulf. They teach language,
agriculture, the building of temples and cities, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
writing; and what the first gave in general terms the
others expound in detail. Hence it would appear
that civilisation, culture, and writing came to the
Chald&aelig;ans from the south, from the shore of the
Persian Gulf. The sevenfold revelation points to
the seven sacred books of the priesthood, of which
the last six explained by special rules the doctrine
contained in the first. The fragments lay especial
weight on the fact that the sacred books were already
in existence before the flood, were saved from it, and
again dug up at Sippara. Pliny remarks that the
mysteries of the Chald&aelig;ans were taught at Sippara.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
Beside this city (the site is marked by the mounds at
Sifeira, above Babylon, on the Euphrates) the fragments
mention Larancha and Babylon. The first two kings
before the flood were Chald&aelig;ans of Babylon, the next
five, Chald&aelig;ans of Sippara, the last three, Chald&aelig;ans
of Larancha. If we set aside the time before the
flood, we find that the first dynasty of eighty-six
kings after the flood reigned for 34,080 years; more
than 5,000 years are allotted to the first two kings;
and about 29,000 are left for the remaining eighty-four.
Looking at these numbers, and remembering
that the Babylonians reckoned by certain cycles of
years, sosses of 60 years, neres of 600, and sares of
3,600, we may suppose that the priests brought the
times before and after the flood into a certain number
of sares. The 432,000 years before the flood make up
120 sares (the 720,000 years of Pliny would make
200 sares). The period after the flood may have been
fixed at a tenth part of that sum, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, at 12 sares,
or 43,200 years. The 34,080 years allotted to the first
dynasty after the flood do not come out in any round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
number of sares. If we suppose that these cycles were
first instituted after Babylon had succumbed to the
attack of Cyrus, and that the fall of Babylon before his
arms coincided with the end of the tenth sarus after
the flood, then of the 36,000 years, which, according to
the opinion we ascribe to the Babylonian priests, had
elapsed from the flood to the conquest of Babylon in
the year 538 <small>B.C.</small>, 34,080 belong to the mythical
dynasty after the flood, and 1,920 years are left for
the historical times down to this date. The taking of
Babylon is a known date, and if to it we add 1,920
years, we get the year 2458 <small>B.C.</small> as the first year of the
historical period. The first ruler of the third dynasty
of Berosus began to reign in the year 2458 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The
same result and number of years comes out if we
add up the separate items in the dynasties, given in
the fragments, from the year 538 <small>B.C.</small> to the first king
of the third dynasty, and leave out of sight the very
striking fact that the fragments break off the Assyrian
dynasty before Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Samuges,
who certainly belong to it, and fill up the chasm thus
made in the succession of dynasties by the 140 years
which the canon of Ptolemy show to have preceded
the accession of Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;a canon which has
no historical object in view, no dynasties to tabulate,
but is merely intended to fix the years from which
observations made by the Chald&aelig;ans were in existence.
If this is the right method<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> of ascertaining the first
established starting-point for the history of the lower
land upon the two streams, the beginnings of civilisation
in these districts may be placed not much below
the year 3000 <small>B.C.</small> Life must have become richer in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Babylonia before the tribes of the Iranian uplands
were roused to obtain the sovereignty of that country.
Still it remains a remarkable fact that the history of
Babylonia begins with the dominion of strangers, and
that the native tradition, as we can show from the
fragments of it remaining to our times, had nothing
to place before the strangers, except the two mythical
dynasties of Babylonian princes before and after the
flood. In the fragments the first native dynasty of
historical times, the dynasty of the Chald&aelig;an princes,
comes in the fifth place; according to the calculation
given above, their supremacy began in the year 1976
<small>B.C.</small>, and already in 1518 <small>B.C.</small> it gave place first to the
nine Arabian, and then to the Assyrian kings. The
statement of the fragments, that forty-nine native
kings reigned, in the 458 years from 1976 <small>B.C.</small> to
1518 <small>B.C.</small>, is also remarkable, since it allows for the
reign of each of the kings of this dynasty the brief
average of a little more than nine years.</p>

<p>But perhaps the Scriptures of the Hebrews, and
the monuments of Babylonia and Assyria, present
sufficient material to supplement these meagre results
in the way of confirmation or contradiction?
According to Genesis, the sons of Shem, the eldest son
of Noah, were "Elam and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and
Lud, and Aram." And the eldest son of Ham, Noah's
second son, was Cush, and Cush begat Nimrod; the
same "began to be a mighty one in the earth, and the
beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> From this
we see not only the close relationship between the
Hebrews and the population of Mesopotamia, but also
the precedence in high antiquity allowed by the
Hebrews to the tribes of the Tigris and Euphrates. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Hebrews derived their own origin from Noah, Shem,
and Arphaxad; but before Arphaxad they place the
two elder sons of Shem, Elam and Asshur. The first
is the representative of the nation and land of Elam
on the lower Tigris, while Asshur represents the
Assyrians of the upper Tigris. But, strangely enough,
the Babylonians were not reckoned in the generations
of Shem, although, as we know perfectly well, the
Chald&aelig;ans were Semitic, and spoke a Semitic language
closely resembling Hebrew. On the contrary,
the founding of the kingdom of Babylon is ascribed
to another stock, the eldest son of Cush, and grandson
of Ham. As Genesis, like the Hebrews of later date,
includes under the name of Cush the nations dwelling
to the south, the Nubians, Ethiopians, and tribes of
South Arabia, we may here take the son of Cush,
who founded Babylon, to represent a southern tribe,
dwelling perhaps on the shore of the Persian Gulf.
Thus as the fragments of Berosus derive the civilisation
of Babylon from the south sea and the south,
so also does Genesis point to a southern origin for
Babylonia. And at the same time Genesis calls
a tribe dwelling on the lower Tigris, between the
river and the mountains of Iran, the Elamites, the
oldest son of Shem. Among the Greeks the land of
the Elamites was known as Kissia, and afterwards as
Susiana, from the name of the capital. It was also
called Elymais, and, in the inscriptions of the
Ach&aelig;menids, Uwazha. The Greeks describe this
district as a hot but very fruitful plain, well watered
by the tributaries of the Tigris from the mountains
of Persia. There the land brought forth two or even
three hundredfold. According to Strabo the land was
inhabited by two tribes, the Kissians and Elym&aelig;ans.
The chief city, Susa, lay between the Shapur and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Dizful.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> With the Greeks it passed as the fortress of
Memnon, the son of the Dawn, who came to the aid
of the Trojans in their distress&mdash;"the ancient mighty
city," as &AElig;schylus calls it.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> The inscriptions of
the Assyrian kings give us some information of the
fortunes of the kingdom of Elam, which is not contradicted
by such isolated indications as we can
gather from the inscriptions of Babylonia. This
evidence shows that in Elam from the year 2500 <small>B.C.</small>
a political constitution was in existence, and that the
kings of Elam invaded Babylonia before the year
2000 <small>B.C.</small>, and about this time ruled over Babylonia
and Mesopotamia as far as Syria. Hence before the
year 2000 <small>B.C.</small> there was some kind of constitution
in Babylonia, and, as we shall see, it was accompanied
by a certain amount of culture. The dominion
of Elam over Babylon was of short duration, and Babylon
soon recovered her independence. When, about
the year 1500 <small>B.C.</small>, Assyria rose into an independent
state, and her power, after 900 <small>B.C.</small>, became dangerous
to the neighbouring states&mdash;when Babylonia, after
the middle of the eighth century <small>B.C.</small>, was no longer
a match for Assyria,&mdash;Elam continued to maintain
her independence in spite of numerous attacks from
the Assyrians.</p>

<p>It was not till the subjection of Babylonia was
complete that the Assyrian king Assurbanipal succeeded
in reducing Elam, and in taking and destroying
Susa, the ancient metropolis of the country. In
his inscriptions this king of Assyria informs us that
King Kudur-Nanchundi<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> of Elam laid his hand on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the temples of Accad (<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>); two neres, seven
sosses, and fifteen years,&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, 1,635 years previously,
he carried away the image of the goddess Nana. He
(Assurbanipal) brought her back; on the first of the
month Kisallu (Kislev) the goddess was conducted
back to Erech (<a href="#Page_237">p. 237</a>); in Bithiliana he built for
her a lasting sanctuary. As Elam was not completely
subdued by Assurbanipal till the year 645 <small>B.C.</small>, we
may place the recovery of the statue of Nana in this
year.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Hence the date of Kudur-Nanchundi of Elam,
whom an inscription of Susa calls the son of Sutruk-Nanchundi,
would fall in the year 2280 <small>B.C.</small>, and if
about this time it was possible to carry away images
of gods from Babylonia, we cannot place the beginnings
of civilisation in Babylonia later than the year
2500 <small>B.C.</small> Tiles found at Mugheir, at no great distance
from the mouth of the Euphrates in Babylonia, belong
to a second king with a name of similar formation&mdash;Kudur-Mabuk.
His inscriptions tell us that Kudur-Mabuk,
lord of the west-land (martu), had erected a
shrine to the god "Sin, his king, for prolonging his
own life and that of his son, Zikar-Sin."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> On a
statuette of bronze, now in the Louvre, we also read
the name of Kudur-Mabuk and his son. Babylonian
inscriptions speak of battles of Hammurabi king of
Babylon against Kudur-Mabuk and against Elam.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
The tradition of the Hebrews tells us that the kings
of Sodom and Gomorrah, the kings of Adama,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Zeboiim, and Zoar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the princes of the land of
Jordan, whose names are quoted, had served Kedor-Laomer,
king of Elam, for twelve years, and when they
revolted, Kedor-Laomer and the princes with him,
Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch and Tidal, had come down
and conquered the Horites, the Amalekites, and the
Amorites, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the tribes of the Syrian desert, the
land of Aram between Sinai and Hermon; and the
kings of Jordan were defeated in the valley of Siddim.
The first part of the name Kedor-Laomer corresponds
to Kudur in the name Kudur-Nanchundi and Kudur-Mabuk.
The second part recurs in the name Lagamar,
which is the name of a god worshipped by the Elamites.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
According to this, the Kudurids, or kings of Elam, of
whom Sutruk and Kudur-Nanchundi, Kudur-Mabuk,
and Kudur-Lagamar are known by name, first attacked
Babylonia, then became rulers of Babylonia, and at one
time extended their dominion to the west as far as Syria.
According to the computations of the Hebrews, the
campaign of Kedor-Laomer to Syria would take place
about the year 2100 <small>B.C.</small> The inscription would carry
the beginning of the rule of the Kudurids in Elam to
the year 2500 <small>B.C.</small>, and consequently the beginning of
a political constitution in Elam may be assumed to be
prior to the year 2300 <small>B.C.</small>, and the sovereignty of the
Kudurids over Babylon and in the west may be placed
about the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>If Elam was once more powerful than Babylon it
may have been also older&mdash;as among the Hebrews
Elam is the eldest son of Shem&mdash;the civilisation of the
Elamites may have developed earlier than that of the
Babylonians. But although a number of names of
kings have been handed down to us on Assyrian
tablets, which also tell us of ceaseless battles with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Elam, we are in almost total darkness about the
nature and direction of the civilisation of Elam. Our
first notice is the Assyrian account of the fall of the
kingdom and the capture of the capital, and from this
we learn that the conditions and mode of life in the
capital of the Elamites were not very different from
those of Babylon and Nineveh. A picture of the city
(found in the palace of Assurbanipal), shows it to us
between the two rivers (<a href="#Page_249">p. 249</a>), oblong in shape, and
surrounded by high walls with numerous towers. Outside
the city, between the walls and the rivers are palms,
and some dwelling-houses.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Assurbanipal narrates:
"Shushan, the great city, the abode of their gods, the
seat of their oracle, I took. I entered into their palaces
and opened their treasure-houses. Gold and silver,
and furniture, and goods, gathered together by the
kings of Elam in times past and in the present, the
brass and precious stones with which the kings of
Accad, Samuges, and those before him had paid their
mercenaries&mdash;the treasures on which no enemy before
me had laid a hand, I brought forth to Assyria. I
destroyed the tower of Shushan. The god of their
oracles, who dwelt in the groves, whose image no man
had seen, and the images of the gods Sumudu, Lagamar
and the others (nineteen are mentioned), which the
kings of Elam worshipped, I conveyed with their priests
to Assyria. Thirty-two statues of the kings in silver,
brass, and alabaster, I took from Shushan. Madaktu
and Huradi, and the statues of Ummanigas, of Istar-Nanchundi,
Halludus, and Tammaritu the younger, I
carried to Assyria. I broke the winged lions and
bulls which guarded the temple, and removed the
winged bulls which stood at the gates of the temples
of Elam. Their gods and goddesses I sent into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
captivity."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> More than a hundred years after this time
the Elamites had not forgotten their independence,
and they attempted to recover it by repeated
rebellions against the Persians.</p>

<p>The inscriptions in which the kings of Persia spoke
to the nations of their wide empire are of a triple
character. Three different kinds of cuneiform writing
repeat the same matter in three different languages.
The first gives the inscription in the Persian language,
the language of the king and dominant people, the
third repeats it in the Babylonian-Assyrian language.
The second, we may suppose, gives the inscription in
the language of Elam, for the Persian kings resided in
Susa, and in the enumeration of the subject territories,
Susiana and Babylonia as a rule come after Persia.
The forms of the language in cuneiform inscriptions
on bricks and tiles discovered in the ruins of Susa
are closely related to the language of the cuneiform
inscriptions of the second kind in the inscriptions
of the Ach&aelig;menids.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> So far as these have been
deciphered the language contained in them seems for
the most part to be closely related to the Turkish-Tatar
languages,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> while the names of the Elamite gods
preserved in Assyrian inscriptions, although different
from those of Babylonia and Assyria, and also the
names of the kings of Elam, have more of a Semitic
than a Turkish-Tatar sound.</p>

<p>On Assyrian tablets, beside the Assyrian and
Babylonian names of the month, which are also the
Hebrew names, we find names in another language
unknown to us;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and the symbols of the Assyrian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
cuneiform writing are not only explained by the
addition of the phonetic value and actual meaning,
but before the substantives, verb-forms, and declensions
of the Babylonian-Assyrian language are placed
the corresponding words and inflections of another
language, which is decidedly of a non-Semitic
character, and also seems to belong to the Turkish-Tatar
branch of language.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> If it was considered
necessary in Babylonia and Assyria to place another
language before or beside their own, the relation of
this language to that spoken by the Babylonians and
Assyrians must have been very close. The most
probable supposition is that it was the language of
the ancient population of the land about the lower
course of the two streams, which afterwards became
subjected to Semitic immigrants. Whatever be the
value of this supposition, we may in any case assume
that the Semitic races found older inhabitants and
an older civilisation on the lower Euphrates and
Tigris. This older population was even then in
possession of a system of writing, and this civilisation
and writing was adopted by the Semitic races, just as
at a later time the Armenians, Medes, and Persians
borrowed their cuneiform writing from the inhabitants
of Babylonia, Assyria, and Susiana.</p>

<p>The precedence of Elam in Hebrew tradition, the
statement of Berosus that civilisation came from the
Persian Gulf, the ancient supremacy of Elam over
Babylonia, which we can discover from the Hebrew
tradition, and more plainly from the inscriptions, are
so many proofs that the oldest seats of culture in the
lower lands of the Euphrates and Tigris lay at the
mouths of the two rivers. And this conclusion receives
further support from the fact that the oldest centres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of the Babylonian state were nearer the mouth of the
Euphrates. Perhaps we may even go a step further.
The Hebrews ascribe the foundation of the Babylonian
kingdom to a son of the south. The language and
religious conceptions of the Babylonians and Assyrians
show a close relationship with the language and
religion of the tribes of South Arabia; some of these
tribes are in Genesis variously enrolled among the
descendants of Shem and of Cush. Hence we may
perhaps assume that Arabian tribes on the sea-shore
forced their way eastward, to the land at the mouth of
the Euphrates and Tigris, and then, passing up the
stream, settled in the valley of the two rivers, as far
as the southern offshoots of the Armenian mountains.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Of these Semitic tribes those which remained on the
lower Tigris and subjected the old population of
Susiana, could not absorb the conquered Kissians
(<a href="#Page_249">p. 249</a>). The old language retained the upper hand,
and developed; and the ruling tribe, the Semitic
Elamites, were amalgamated with the ancient population.
It was otherwise on the lower Euphrates, where
the Semitic immigrants succeeded&mdash;probably in a long
process of time, since it was late and by slow degrees
that they gained the upper hand&mdash;in absorbing the old
Turanian population, and formed a separate Semitic
community, when they had borrowed from their predecessors
the basis of civilisation and the system of
cuneiform writing which was invented for another
language.</p>

<p>In the fragments of Berosus the inhabitants of
Babylonia are called Chaldees, a name which Western
writers give especially to the priests of Babylon,
though even to them a district on the lower Euphrates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
is known as Chald&aelig;a.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The inscriptions of the Assyrian
kings name the whole land Kaldi, and the inhabitants
Kaldiai.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> To the Hebrews, as has been observed
(<a href="#Page_248">p. 248</a>), Erech, Accad, and Calneh were the beginning
of the kingdom of Nimrod.  In the fragments of
Berosus, Babylon, the Bab-Ilu of the inscriptions, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
"Gate of Il (El)," Sippara and Larancha are supposed
to be in existence before the flood. Erech, the Orchoe
of the Greeks, and Arku of the inscriptions, is the
modern Warka, to the south of Babylon on the
eastern bank of the Euphrates, where vast heaps of
ruins remain to testify to the former importance of
the city.  The site of Calneh and of the Larancha
mentioned in the fragments cannot be ascertained,
unless the latter city is the same as the Larsam
mentioned in the inscriptions. In these the name
Accad  occurs very frequently.  The kings of
Babylon, and after them the kings of Assyria, who
ruled over Babylon, called themselves kings of Babel,
of Sumir, and Accad, names which are used to denote
the districts (perhaps Upper and Lower Babylonia)
and their inhabitants. Sippara, the city of the sacred
books and mystic lore of the Chald&aelig;ans (<a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>),
is called by the Hebrews, Sepharvaim, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the two
Sepher." Sepher means "writing." It was therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the Babylonian City of Scriptures. The Hebrews were
aware that this city worshipped the gods Adar and
Anu, Adrammelech and Anammelech. The inscriptions
also mention two cities of the name of Sippara, or as
they give the word, Shipar; they distinguish the
Shipar of the god Anu from the Shipar of Samas, the
sun-god. The cuneiform symbol for Sippara means
"City of the sun of the four quarters of the earth,"
and the Euphrates is denoted by a symbol which
means "River of Sippara."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> From this it is clear
what position this city once took in Babylonia. The
Ur Kasdim, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "Ur of the Chald&aelig;ans" in the Hebrew
Scriptures, is the modern Mugheir, south-east of
Babylon; on clay-tablets discovered in the ruins of
this place we find cuneiform symbols, which are to
be read as "Uru."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> The Kutha and Telassar of the
Hebrews also recur in the Kuthi and Tel Assur of the
inscriptions. In his inscriptions Sennacherib boasts
that in the year 704 <small>B.C.</small> he took eighty-nine fortified
cities and 820 places in Babylonia, beside Babylon
itself.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The tumuli covering the ruins of these cities and
the Assyrian inscriptions have preserved for us the
names of more than fifty of the kings who once ruled
over Babylon. The fragments of Berosus limit the
period of the independence of Babylon to the 458 years
from 1976 <small>B.C.</small>, to 1518 <small>B.C.</small> (<a href="#Page_248">p. 248</a>), and after the
Chald&aelig;an kings of this period they place Arabian
kings down to 1273 <small>B.C.</small>, who in turn are followed by
the Assyrian kings. These statements are flatly contradicted
by the inscriptions of Babylonia and Assyria.
We have already seen that in the period from about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the year 2300 <small>B.C.</small> to 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, Elam had the preponderance,
and in part the sovereignty, over Babylonia.
Afterwards Babylon became independent, and maintained
her position even against Assyria, until, after
the ninth century before Christ, the latter gained
the upper hand; and then, from the beginning of the
seventh century, for a period of seventy or eighty years,
the independence of Babylon was entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>As yet it is not possible to arrange the names preserved
in the inscriptions in a definite order. We
can only perceive that in the oldest period Babylon
was not yet the capital of the kingdom. Erech, Ur,
and Nipur, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> cities lying to the south, were the seat
of government. We find also that the power of the
ancient princes must have extended to the mouth of the
Euphrates, and afterwards over a part of Mesopotamia,
and over the Assyrian district on the upper Tigris, till
Assyria, about the year 1500 <small>B.C.</small>, became an independent
kingdom. That the region of the upper Euphrates
did not belong to Babylonia, but was the seat of independent
princes, more especially at Karchemish, is
shown by the campaigns of the Pharaohs against
Naharina, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Mesopotamia, which fall in the period
between 1650 <small>B.C.</small> and 1350 <small>B.C.</small>, and the assistance
which was rendered at this time by the princes of the
upper Euphrates to the Syrians against the Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
Afterwards the Assyrians forced their way over the
upper Euphrates towards Syria, without coming in
conflict with the Babylonians. At a later period the
lower part of Chald&aelig;a separated from Babylon, and
independent princes established themselves on the
lower Euphrates&mdash;a fact which obviously was of great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
assistance to the Assyrians in gaining the upper hand
over Babylon.</p>

<p>Among the ancient princes of Babylon one of the
first places must be allotted to a king whose name
is read as Urukh. On tiles discovered at Warka
(Erech) we find that the "king of Ur, king of Sumir
and Accad, has built a temple to his Lady, the
goddess Nana;" on tiles discovered at Mugheir (Ur),
it is said that "Urukh has built the temple and fortress
of Ur in honour of his Lord, the god Sin;" and
finally on an inscription of Nabonetus, the last king of
Babylon, which he had surrendered as far as Ur, we
are told that Urukh began to build a temple here
to the great goddess, and that his son Ilgi completed
it. At Nipur (Niffer), Urukh built temples to Bel
and Bilit, and a temple to the god Samas at the
modern Senkereh.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> On a cylinder of Urukh we find
three beardless forms, apparently the king, his son,
and the queen, holding up their hands to an aged
long-bearded and seated figure, which the new moon
visible above him denotes as the moon-god Sin; the
inscription, written in the older form of cuneiform
writing (see below), runs thus: "Of Urukh, the
mighty Lord, the King of Ur,..." Another cylinder
belongs to the time of his son Ilgi. It bears the
inscription: "For saving the life of Ilgi, from the
mighty Lord, the king of Ur, son of Urukh. May his
name continue!" Inscriptions on tiles inform us that
he built a temple at Mugheir.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> King Ismidagon (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
"Dagon hears"), whose name is also found on tiles of
Mugheir, is entitled on them, "Lord of Nipur,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of Sumir, and Accad." Of king Sarruk (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "strong
is the king") an inscription tells us that he built the
city of Agane, and the tablets of prognostication
announce to him, that he will conquer Elam, and
subjugate the whole of Babylonia and Syria.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The
inscriptions of king Hammurabi (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the sun-god is
great") discovered at Babylon, Zerghul, and Tell Sifr,
tell us that the gods El and Bel had delivered the
inhabitants of Sumir and Accad to his dominion, that
he had overthrown Elam, and conquered Mabuk (<a href="#Page_251">p.
251</a>), and that he had caused the river Hammurabi
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the canal of that name) to be dug for the benefit
of the Babylonians, and had provided a constant
supply of water for Sumir and Accad. At the command
of Merodach he had erected a fortress on this
canal, of which the towers were as high as mountains,
and had named it after the name of his father Dur-Ummubanit.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>Hammurabi is the first who, according to his inscriptions,
resided at Babylon. If Sarrukin and he
succeeded in breaking down the supremacy of Elam,
we must put Hammurabi at the head of the dynasty
which reigned over Babylon, according to Berosus, from
1976-1518 <small>B.C.</small> (<a href="#Page_248">p. 248</a>). In an Assyrian list of the
kings of Babylon, belonging to the times of Assurbanipal,
we find, after Hammurabi, the names of
more than fifteen kings, and opposite the last of
these, king Binsumnasir of Babylon, two kings of
Assyria, Assurnirar and Nabudan, are placed as
contemporaries (between 1500 and 1450 <small>B.C.</small>; see
below).<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>  Then Karatadas, of Babylon, makes an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
alliance with Assurbel-nisi, king of Assyria, and the
friendship was continued under their successors, Purnapuryas
of Babylon, and Busurassur of Assyria (about
1450 to 1400 <small>B.C.</small>) Assuruballit, the successor of Busurassur,
made war upon Nazibugas, the usurper who
succeeded Purnapuryas, and raised to the throne in
his place Kurigalzu, a son of Purnapuryas (about
1400 <small>B.C.</small>) Tiles at Senkereh inform us that Purnapuryas,
"king of Babylon, of Sumir and Accad,"
restored the great temple which Urukh had built
for the sun-god Samas. Tiles are found at Ur
(Mugheir) with the name Kurigalzu; and the
fortress Dur-Kurigalzu (Akerkuf), which is often
mentioned in later Assyrian inscriptions, and spoken
of as "the key of Babylonia," was built, as is proved
by the stamp on the tiles, in the reign of this king.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
An ornament, now in the British Museum, has the
inscription: "Kurigalzu, son of Purnapuryas, king of
Babel."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The grandson of Kurigalzu was Merodach-Baladan
(Marduk-habaliddina, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "Merodach presented
the son").<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Then about the year 1300 <small>B.C.</small>,
Tiglath Adar (Tuklat Adar), of Assyria, attacked the
Babylonians, at first, as it seems, with success, but
at last he lost his seal in this war, and for 600
years it was preserved in the treasury at Babylon.
Still more unfortunate was Belkudurussur of Assyria
in his attempt on Babylon. He was defeated, and fell
himself in the battle (about 1200 <small>B.C.</small>); his successor
also, Adarpalbitkur, barely succeeded in defending
himself from the attacks of the Babylonians. When
afterwards the first Nebuchadnezzar (Nabukudurussur)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of Babylon twice invaded Assyria, Assur-ris-ilim,
king of Assyria (between 1150-1130 <small>B.C.</small>), succeeded
in repulsing him, and Nebuchadnezzar lost forty
war-chariots and a standard. Tiglath Pilesar I.
(Tuklat-habal-assar, about 1120 <small>B.C.</small>), the successor
of Assur-ris-ilim, fought against the Babylonians,
and, like Tiglath Adar, he was at first successful.
Assyrian tablets boast that in two successive years
he had taken Dur-Kurigalzu, both Sipparas (<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>),
and even Babylon. But the result of the war
was that Marduknadinakh, king of Babylon, about
the year 1110 <small>B.C.</small>, carried off images of gods from
Assyria to Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Assur-bel-kala of Assyria
(1110-1090 <small>B.C.</small>) had to fight against another Marduk
of Babylon. Two hundred years later Nebubaladan
of Babylon repulsed the attacks of Assurnasirpal
of Assyria (883-859 <small>B.C.</small>) Then Shalmaneser II.
of Assyria made such excellent use of a contention
for the throne of Babylonia, that in the year
850 <small>B.C.</small> he offered sacrifice at Babylon, Borsippa,
and Kutha. But it was not till the year 703 or
689 <small>B.C.</small> that the seal of Tiglath Adar and the
images lost by Tiglath Pilesar I. were carried back
to Assyria.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE RELIGION AND SCIENCE OF THE CHALD&AElig;ANS.</h3>


<p>In the period from 2000 to 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, Babylonia under
Hammurabi, Nebuchadnezzar, and Marduknadinakh,
was already the foremost state of Hither Asia in power,
science, and skill in art. Her civilisation had developed
without external assistance. If the first foundations
were borrowed, and not laid by the Babylonians, they
certainly were not due to the Egyptians. The religious
views of the Babylonians and the Egyptians rest
on an entirely different basis. In Egypt the heavens
were carefully observed; but the Chald&aelig;ans arrived at
a different division of the heavens, of the year, and
month, and day, and the results of their astronomy
were far clearer and more exact. In Egypt, weights
and measures were regulated by the priests; the
Chald&aelig;ans established a much more accurate and consistent
system, which prevailed far beyond the borders
of Babylonia. The Egyptians reached the highest point
that could be reached by the art of building in stone;
but the buildings of the Chald&aelig;ans in brick are unsurpassed
in size, strength, and height by any nation or
period. To what antiquity the hydraulic works of the
Chald&aelig;ans reached we do not know (the canal of
Hammurabi has been mentioned above); but we find
that in size and variety they were not behind those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of Egypt. Their sculpture cannot be compared with
the Egyptian in artistic finish; but the few fragments
which remain exhibit a style which, while thoroughly
independent, is more vigorous and complete, and
shows a greater freedom of conception than the
Egyptian.</p>

<p>The Babylonians, as we learn from Diodorus, worshipped
twelve gods as lords of the sky. To each of
these a sign in the zodiac and a month in the year
were dedicated.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> These statements are supported by
the inscriptions. The supreme god of the Babylonians
was El (Il), after whom they named their capital,
Babel, "Gate of El." After El came the gods Anu,
Bel (Bil), Hea, Sin, Samas, and Bin; and after these
the gods of the planets; Adar, Merodach, Nergal,
Istar, and Nebo. Of El we only know that he was the
supreme god, who sat enthroned above the other gods.
What peculiar importance and power is ascribed to
him is the more difficult to ascertain, as the name
of the third deity, Bel, simply means "lord," and by
this title not only Bel himself, but El and other gods
also are invoked. In his inscription, king Hammurabi
says "that El and Bel have given over to his rule the
inhabitants of Sumir and Accad." In the story of
the flood, quoted above, El is called "the prince of
the gods," "the warrior." In Assyrian inscriptions
he is the "lamp of the gods," "the lord of the
universe." The Greeks give us accounts of the great
temple of Belus at Babylon, and represent the
Babylonians as swearing "by the great Belus."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> In
the fragments of Berosus it was Belus who smote
asunder the prim&aelig;val darkness, and divided Omorka,
and caused the creation of men and beasts; while
according to the clay tablets of the flood, El was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
unwilling to save even Sisit. Of the god Hea we can
at present ascertain no more from the inscriptions than
that he is the "lord of the earth," "the king of rivers;"
and that it is he who announced the coming flood to
Sisit, and pointed out the means of safety. Anu, the
god who follows next after El, was sovereign of the
upper realms of the sky. In the narrative of the flood
given on the clay tablets the gods fled horror-stricken
before the storm into the heaven of Anu. In Assyrian
inscriptions the god has frequently the epithet Malik
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "king"). As the Hebrews inform us that the
men of Sepharvaim worshipped Anammelech, it is
obvious that Anumalik and Anammelech are one
and the same deity. The creature, who brought the
first revelations of language and writing, is called in
Berosus Oan, by others, Yan.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> As these revelations
reached Sepharvaim, and the sacred books were preserved
there (<a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>), we may venture to assume that
the Oan of Berosus and the Anu of the inscriptions
are the same god. The nature of the next deities, Sin,
Samas, and Bin, is more intelligible. Sin is the god of
the moon. On monuments the new moon is often
found beside his bearded image. The inscriptions
provide him with "white-beaming horns." The main
seat of his worship is Ur (Mugheir), where, as we
have seen, Urukh built him a temple, and Nabonetus,
the last king of Babylon, prays this god "to plant in
the heart of his first-born a reverence for his great
divinity, that he might not yield to sin, or favour the
unfaithful."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The sun-god Samas is distinguished by
sign of the circle; according to the inscription he
illuminates "heaven and earth," and is the "lord of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the day." Beside Sin and Samas the Babylonians
worshipped a deity of the heaven, Bin, the god who
"thunders in the midst of the sky," who holds "a
flaming sword in his hand," "who holds the lightning,"
"who is the giver of abundance, the lord of fertility."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>At the head of the five spirits of the planets stands
the lord of Saturn (the Kaivanu of the Babylonians),
the most distant and highest of all. This is the god
Adar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the sublime." His name was given to the
last month in the Babylonian year. In the inscriptions
the epithet Malik is often joined to Adar; Sakkut
Adar also is a name given in the inscriptions to this
god. The Hebrews tell us that the men of Sepharvaim
worshipped Adrammelech; and this can hardly be
any other deity than the Adar-Malik of the inscriptions.
They also add that children were burned
to Adrammelech,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and hence we may conclude that
the Adar of the Babylonians was a harsh and cruel
deity, averse to generation, whose wrath had to be
appeased by human sacrifice. When the prophet
Amos announces to the Israelites that they would
"carry Siccuth their king, and Kewan (Chiun) their
star-god, their images which they had made,"<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Sichuth-Melech
can be no other god than Sakkut-Malik, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
Adar, and by Kewan is meant the Kaivanu (Saturn)
of the inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Nebo (Nabu), the god of
Borsippa, was the lord of the planet Mercury.
According to the inscriptions of Babylonia, he ruled
over the hosts of heaven and earth. His image on the
cylinder of Urukh has been mentioned above (<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>).
Statues of Nebo with long beard and hair, and a robe
from the breast downwards, have been found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
ruins of Nineveh. Assyrian inscriptions entitle him the
"prince of the gods." His name means the "revealer,"
and what we learn from western writers about a
special school of Chaldaic priests at Borsippa agrees
very well with this. The lord of Mars, Nergal, was
worshipped at the city of Kutha. The inscriptions
name him the "king of the battle," the "ruler of the
storm," or simply the "lion-god."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Hence the winged
lions with a human head at the temples and palace
gates of Susa and Nineveh (<a href="#Page_253">p. 253</a>) were his images, and
stood no doubt at Babylon and Kutha also, while the
winged bulls must have been the images of Adar. In
the narrative of the flood on Assyrian tablets, it is
Adar who overthrows and Nergal who destroys
(<a href="#Page_243">p. 243</a>). After the restoration of the Babylonian
kingdom, the kings are named after Nebo and Nergal.
Yet the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar II. celebrate
above all other deities the lord of Jupiter, Merodach,
as Belrabu, i.e. the "great lord," the "highest god,"
the "lord of heaven and earth."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>To this circle of planet-gods belongs also the female
deity, whom the Babylonians worshipped with much
zeal&mdash;the goddess Bilit, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "Lady," the Mylitta of
Herodotus. Her star is Venus. The inscriptions name
her "Queen of the Gods," "Mother of the Gods." As
she is also called the "Lady of Offspring," it is clear
that she was regarded by the Babylonians as the goddess
of fertility and birth. They recognised the power of
the goddess in the charm and beauty of vegetative
nature. Within the wall of her temple at Babylon a
grove afforded a cool shade, and a cistern reminded
the worshippers of the mistress of the fertilizing water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
The creatures sacred to her were fish, as the inhabitants
of water, and remarkable for vigorous propagation, and
the dove.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> According to the account of Herodotus the
maidens of Babylonia had to worship the goddess by
the sacrifice of their virginity; once in her life each
was expected to sell her body in honour of the goddess,
and thus to redeem herself. Hence on the festivals of
Mylitta the maidens of Babylon sat in long rows
in the grove of the goddess, with chaplets of cord
upon their heads. Even the daughters of the wealthy
came in covered cars with a numerous body of attendants.
Here they had to remain till one of the
pilgrims, who came to worship the goddess, cast a piece
of gold into their laps, with the words, "In the name
of Mylitta." Then the maiden was compelled to follow
him, and comply with his wishes. The money thus
earned she gave to the temple-treasury, and was
henceforth freed from her obligation to the goddess.
"The good-looking and graceful maidens," adds Herodotus,
"quickly found a pilgrim, but the ugly ones
could not satisfy the law, and often remained in the
temple three or four years."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The Hebrew scriptures
confirm the statements of Herodotus. They tell us of
the Babylonians, "that their women, with cords about
them (they were bound to the goddess), sat by the
wayside, and burnt bran for perfume, and she who was
drawn away by the passer-by reproached her fellow
that she had not been thought worthy of the honour,
and that her cord was not broken."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> The goddess
Nana, whose image, as we have seen, was carried away
at an ancient period from Erech to Susa, and to whom
it is Nebuchadnezzar's boast that he built temples at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Babylon and Borsippa,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> was hardly distinguished from
Bilit or Mylitta.</p>

<p>Opposed to the goddess of fertility, procreation,
and birth, stood Istar, the goddess of war, of ruin, and
destruction. She is often mentioned in inscriptions
as "the Queen of Babylon;" according to Assyrian
inscriptions she carries a bow, and western writers tell
us of the worship of Artemis by the Babylonians.
That this goddess united with Bilit, and sent alternately
blessing and fruit, death and ruin, is placed
beyond doubt, by the analogous worship of Baltis,
Ashera, and Astarte by the Syrians, and more
especially by the Ph&#339;nicians and Carthaginians.
Moreover the planet Venus belonged to this goddess
in both her forms. In the tablets of the flood, Istar
boasts that men owed their existence to her (<a href="#Page_243">p. 243</a>),
and an Assyrian syllabarium tells us that "the star
of Venus (Dilbat, the Delephat of the Greeks), at sunrise,
is Istar among the gods; the same star at sunset
is Bilit among the gods."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> On Assyrian tablets is
found a narrative of the journey of Istar to the under-world.
She determines to go down to the house of
the departed, to the abode of the god Irkalla, to the
house which has no exit, to the road which leads not
back, to the place where the entrance is without
light, where dust is their nourishment and mould
their food, where light is not seen, where they dwell
in darkness, where the arches are filled with spirits
like birds; over the gate and the panels dust is
strewed. "Watchman of the waters," said Istar,
"open thy gate, that I may enter. If thou openest
not, I will break thy gate, and burst asunder the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
bars; I will shatter the threshold and destroy the
doors." The watchman opened the gate, and as she
passed through he took the great crown from her head;
and when she passed through the second gate he took
the rings from her ears; and when she passed through
the third gate he took the necklace from her neck;
and when she passed through the fourth gate he took
the ornaments from her breast; and when she passed
through the fifth gate he took the girdle of her robe;
and when she passed through the sixth gate he took
the rings from her arms and legs; and when she passed
through the seventh gate he took the mantle from her
neck and said, "Thus does Ninkigal to those who
come to her." Arrived in the under-world, Istar was
grievously afflicted in the eyes, on the hips, feet, heart,
head, and whole body. But the world above could
not bear the loss of Istar, "the bull sought not the
cow, nor the male ass the female," and the god Hea
sent a message to Ninkigal, the Lady of the under-world,
to set her free. Ninkigal caused the water of
life to pour out over Istar. Then the seven doors of
the under-world were again opened for her, and before
each she received back what had been taken from her
at her entrance.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>In the fragments of Berosus the last of the fish-men
is called Odakon (<a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>). Inscriptions of Hammurabi
and Nebuchadnezzar II. of Babylon mention
a god Dakan, or Dagani; and we also meet the name
of this god in the name of the king Ismidagon, whom
we found it necessary to place before the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small>
Assurbanipal of Assyria boasts of the favour of Anu
and Dagon. These two gods appear in the same
connection in other inscriptions. Sargon, king of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Assyria, calls himself "the apple of the eye of Anu
and Dagon."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Male figures, with a horned cap on
the head, and ending in a fish, and priests with fishskins
hung above them, are often found on the monuments
of Nineveh. As the word Dag means "fish,"
we may with confidence find in the god Dakan the
fish-god of the Babylonians; the god who out of
moisture gives plenty, fertility, and increase. That
the Canaanites also worshipped Dagon is proved by the
names Beth-Dagon and Kaphar-Dagon, which occur
near Joppa and Sichem. The Philistines also on the
coast of the Mediterranean invoked the same god.
His image in the temple at Ashdod had the face and
hands of a man, the body of a fish, and the feet of a
man (see below). The seven fish-men who rose out
of the Persian Gulf were therefore seven manifestations,
or revelations, of the gods Oan and Dagon,
Anu and Dakan.</p>

<p>The chief seats of the religious worship of the Babylonians
were Babylon itself, when it had become the
metropolis of the land, Borsippa and Kutha. The kings
of Assyria, who succeeded in entering Babylonia, or in
subjugating it, remark more than once that they have
sacrificed at Babylon, Borsippa, and Kutha, to Bel,
Nebo, and Nergal, and Assurbanipal tells us that his
rebellious brother, the viceroy of Babylon, had purchased
the help of the Elamites with the treasures
of the temple of Bel at Babylon, of Nebo at Borsippa,
and Nergal at Kutha.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Hence these temples must
have been the most considerable, and the treasures in
them the largest. Beside these temples, as has been
remarked, Erech was of importance, as the seat of
the worship of Nana, Ur contained the temple of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
moon-god, and Sepharvaim was the abode of Anu and
Samas, and the city of the sacred scriptures.</p>

<p>The relation of the deities to the luminaries of the
sky occupied a very prominent place in the minds of
the Babylonians. The powerful operation of the sun
was due to the god Samas; the moon, as we have
seen, belonged to Sin, Saturn to Adar, Jupiter to
Merodach, Mercury to Nebo, Mars to the war-god
Nergal, Venus to Istar-Bilit. From the inscriptions
of Nebuchadnezzar II. we learn that there existed at
Borsippa, the seat of the worship of Nebo, an ancient
temple to "the seven lamps of the earth."  The
horizon of the Babylonian plain was very extensive;
the more uniform and boundless the expanse of earth,
the more did the eye turn upwards towards the
changes, movements, and life of the sky. In the
clear atmosphere the eye followed the regular paths
of the planets, and discovered each morning new stars,
while others disappeared every evening. With the
higher or lower position of the sun, or of this or that
star, a new season commenced, or changes took place
in the natural world; the inundation rose, and vegetation
began to awaken or decay. On the rising
and setting of the sun, the moon, and the stars, the
life of mankind, their waking and sleeping, their
vigour and weariness, depended; the seasons of budding
and ripening fruit, of favourable or unfavourable
navigation, commenced with the appearance of certain
stars and ended with their disappearance. It was
natural, amid such conceptions, to believe that the
whole life of nature and man depended on the luminaries
of the sky, and that the earth and mankind
received their laws from above, from the gleaming
paths of the constellations.  The good or evil effect
which these stars were thought to exercise upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
life of nature, applied also to their influence on the
life of man.</p>

<p>Within the circle of such conceptions the planets
naturally occupied a prominent place. The Greeks
inform us that the Chald&aelig;ans called these stars "interpreters,"
as proclaiming the will of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
Among them Jupiter and Venus (Merodach and
Istar-Bilit) passed with the later astrologers as luck-bringing
powers. Jupiter was supposed to bring the
beneficent and genial warmth of the atmosphere,
while Venus, the star of evening (Bilit), poured forth
the cool fructifying dew. Saturn (Adar) was an unlucky
star, the Great Evil; and this confirms the
conclusion already drawn that Adar was thought to be
a god averse to generation, and hostile. Mars (Nergal)
was also a pernicious planet: his fiery glow brought
scorching heat, and he is the Lesser Evil of astrologers.
Mercury, the moon, and the sun, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Nebo, Sin, and
Samas, stood midway between the good and evil
stars; they were of an intermediate undefined
character.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>But according to the Chald&aelig;ans the planets also assumed
the influence and character of the constellations
in which they passed over the earth. They divided
the path of the sun into twelve stations or houses,
according to the constellations which it passes through
in its course. The sun's proper house was its highest
position in the sign of Leo. The paths of the planets
were divided in a similar way; and to the Chald&aelig;an
these "houses of the planets" became divine powers,
because they altered and defined the character and
operation of the planets. Hence they even call them
"lords of the gods."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> On the other hand thirty
other fixed stars are "counselling gods," because they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
were thought to exercise only a secondary influence
on the planets; and lastly, twelve fixed stars in the
northern sky, and twelve in the southern were called
the "judges." Of these twenty-four stars, those
which were visible decided on the fortunes of the
living, and those which were invisible on the fortunes
of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The inscriptions also distinguish two
classes of twelve stars each; of which one is named
"the stars of Accad," the other "the stars of the
West."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Each month of the year belonged to a
god; the first to the god Anu: the seven days of
the week belonged to the sun, moon, and five
planets; after the moon came Mars, then Mercury,
then Jupiter, then Venus, and last of all Saturn.
The day belonged to the planet to which the first
hour after midnight was allotted; in the next hour
the planet ruled which came next in proximity to the
sun; and in the same way followed the remaining
planets, first in a solar, then in a lunar series.</p>

<p>Thus the Chald&aelig;ans worshipped "the sun, and the
moon, and the zodiac;" thus they offered incense, as
the Hebrews say, to the "houses of the planets, and
the whole host of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> This lore was the work
of the priests, who accordingly understood how to
read the will of the gods in the constellations of the
sky, and to foretell the fate of life from the hour of
birth, and from the ever-changing position of the
stars to fix the suitable moment for commencing any
task or undertaking. How the stars passed through
the sky, how they approached each other, or diverged,
imparted or withdrew their operation, were found in
equipoise or opposition&mdash;on this depended the prosperity
or misfortune of the kingdom, the king, the year, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
day, the hour. Moreover it was of importance at
what season of the year, and in what quarter of the
sky the stars rose, or disappeared, and what colours
they displayed.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> To the east belonged withering heat,
to the south warmth, to the west fertilising moisture,
and to the north cold; and the planets exercised
greater or less power as they stood higher or lower.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
Tablets discovered at Nineveh allow us a closer insight
into the system of these constellations. On some of
these we find written as follows:&mdash;"If Jupiter is seen in
the month of Tammuz, there will be corpses." "If Venus
comes opposite the star of the fish, there will be
devastation." "If the star of the great lion is gloomy,
the heart of the people will not rejoice." "If the moon
is seen on the first day of the month, Accad will
prosper." One tablet supplies information for all the
periods of the day and night in the 360 days of the
year, telling us what day and what period is favourable
or unfavourable for commencing a campaign, or a
siege, for storming the enemy's walls, or for defence.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Such was the faith and doctrine of the Babylonians.
In the original conception of El as lord of the sky,
and Adar as the highest of the star gods, there may
have been nobler and simpler traits, yet even these
early views were not without their harshness and
cruelty, as we are forced to conclude from the Hebrew
accounts of the sacrifices offered to Adar. Such traits
are also more than outweighed by the licentious
worship of Mylitta, in which the sensual elements of
the Semitic character are seen in all their coarseness.
With the growth of the kingdom, and the consequent
effeminacy and luxury of life in Babylonia, this side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of their religion must have become predominant, while,
on the other hand, the great conception of a world
ruled and governed by the movements of the stars
tended in time to degenerate into mere astrological
computations and fortune-telling.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the life and position of the priests
of Babylon is scanty. The Greeks tell us that they
took the same place as in Egypt. Their rank was
hereditary; the son was instructed by the father from
an early age. Some occupied themselves with the offerings
and purifications; others strove to avert existing
or threatening evils by expiations and charms;
others explained any miraculous phenomena of nature,
interpreted dreams, and prophesied from the flight of
birds. The Hebrew scriptures speak of interpreters of
stars and signs, magicians and prophets.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> According
to the accounts of Western writers, the priests at
Babylon inhabited a special quarter of the city, and
there were schools of priests at Sippara.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The fragments
of Berosus pointed out Babylon, Sippara, and
Larancha (<a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>) as centres of priestly wisdom even
before the flood, inasmuch as they attribute to these
places special revelations of the gods Anu and Dakan.
They speak of the sacred books saved in Sippara from
the flood. These books they divide into ancient,
medi&aelig;val, and modern. By the "ancient" books we
must understand the announcements which the god Anu
caused to be made to the two earliest kings, Alorus
and Alaparus, of Babylon. Under the "medi&aelig;val" are
comprised the revelations received by Ammenon and
Daonus of Sippara, and lastly, under the "modern"
the mysteries disclosed by Dagon to Edorankhus of
Sippara (<a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>). Hence we may assume that the priests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
of Babylon arrived at an early age at a code which
included their creed and ritual, as it would seem, in
seven books (<a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>). How high the cosmogonies go,
of which the most essential traits were found in the
fragments of Berosus (<a href="#Page_238">p. 238</a>), we cannot decide. In the
conception which lies at the base of them the forces of
nature are seen pouring forth in wild confusion. The
name of the woman who rules these forces, or of this
chaos inhabited by monsters, Omorka, has been explained
as "Homer-Kai," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, "material of the egg,"
the world-egg, but more recently by "Um Uruk," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
"the mother," the "great goddess of Erech." In the
cosmogony of Berosus we can see, though in a very
rude and contradictory shape, the opposition of a
material and intellectual, a natural and supernatural
principle, and later accounts maintain that the
Babylonians regarded the world as arising out of fire
and water, that Chaos and Love were the parents
of Life and Contention, and of Life and Contention
Bel was the son.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>More important and far more valuable than these
abstractions, to which the Babylonians obviously attained
only at a late period, and in all probability under
the influence of Greek ideas, are the results which
their knowledge and acuteness gained in other fields.
The cuneiform writing, according to the conclusions we
have already been compelled to draw, was borrowed
by the Elamites and Babylonians from the earlier inhabitants
of the lower districts. It was originally a
picture-writing, which, like the Egyptian, passed from
real pictures to indicatory and symbolic pictures or
picture-signs. The necessity of abbreviating and
compressing the picture-signs was here far more keenly
felt than in Egypt, quite irrespective of the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the strong pictorial tendency of the Egyptians was
probably wanting on the Lower Tigris. The stones
and slabs on which the Egyptians engraved their
hieroglyphics were not to be found in the plains of the
two rivers, and the slabs of mud, clay, and brick on
which they were compelled to write (the pictures and
symbols were written on the soft slabs with the style,
and these were then burnt), were ill-adapted for sketches.
Such obstinate material made the abbreviation of the
symbols an imperative necessity; and it was by sharp
and straight strokes that the signs could be most easily
traced upon slabs of mud and clay. The oldest bricks
in the ruins of Mugheir, Warka, and Senkereh display
pictures in outline; then beside bricks with
inscriptions of this kind we find others repeating the
same inscription in cuneiform signs, which now form
a completely ideographic system of writing. The
immediate comprehension of picture signs by the
senses died away owing to abbreviations of the kind
mentioned, and the picture-writing became symbolic
writing. This writing, which consisted of groups
of cuneiform symbols, attained a higher stage of
development when a phonetic value was attributed
to a part of the cuneiform groups, whether used to
signify nouns or verbs and adjectives, or new
groups were formed for this purpose. By cuneiform
groups both simple and compound syllables are expressed.
For simple syllables, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for those consisting
of a single consonant with a vowel before or after
it in order to give the consonant a sound, the
cuneiform writing of Babylon and Assyria possesses
about one hundred groups, and several hundred groups
for compound syllables, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for those which have
more than one consonant. Side by side with this
syllabic writing the old abbreviated picture-writing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
was retained. Certain words of frequent occurrence,
as king, battle, month, were always represented
by picture signs, or ideograms, and so also were the
names of deities and most proper names. The greater
number of the cuneiform groups were then used in
a phonetic as well as an ideographic sense, and
without any correlation between the phonetic and
actual meaning. Thus the symbol for the word
"father" had the phonetic value of the syllable
<i>at</i>, but "father" in the Babylonian language is
<i>abu</i>. In Babylon this system of writing became
even more complicated by the fact that different
meanings and different phonetic values were ascribed
to the same cuneiform groups. There are
symbols which have four different phonetic values
and four different meanings.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> In order to lessen to
some degree the great difficulty in understanding the
meaning which was caused by the varying use of the
same symbol as an ideogram and a sound, and the
multiplicity of meanings and sounds attached to
certain signs&mdash;key-symbols were placed before the
names of gods, lands, cities, and persons, and occasionally
one or more syllables were attached to ideograms
of more than one meaning, which formed the
termination of the word intended to be expressed
by the ideogram in the particular instance.</p>

<p>Complicated and difficult as this writing was, it
was applied on a considerable scale in Assyria and
Babylonia, and it remained in use even after the fall
of the Babylonian empire, as is shown by bricks and
tablets of the time of Cyrus, Cambyses, Artaxerxes I.,
and the Seleucid&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> These are principally records of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
business or legal matters, of which, in this way, a
selection has come down to us extending from the
times of Hammurabi (<a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>) to the first century <small>B.C.</small>
The Armenians adopted this system from the Babylonians
and Assyrians; and they also made it shorter
and simpler. In the same way the Medes and
Persians borrowed it. But in the Persian inscriptions
of the Ach&aelig;menids it has already become a mere
phonetic mode of writing but little removed from
an ordinary alphabet. Beyond doubt the Babylonian
system was known to the Western Semitic tribes; it
even passed over from Syria to Cyprus, where we find
it assuming a peculiar form, and displaying throughout
the character of a syllabic mode of writing. At the
same time among the Syrians and Phenicians a cursive
method was developed, just as in Egypt the hieratic
writing grew up beside the hieroglyphic. This
cursive writing of the Western Semitic nations has
not, however, arisen out of the cuneiform symbols,
but out of the hieratic writing of the Egyptians. The
Phenicians must claim the merit of having abbreviated
still further, for their own use, the cursive writing
of the Egyptians. But the picture-symbols of the
hieratic writing were not merely contracted and
simplified; the mixture of pictorial, syllabic, and
alphabetic symbols&mdash;beyond which the Egyptians did
not rise&mdash;was abandoned, and then for the first time
an alphabet was discovered. This Phenician alphabet
was in use in Syria as early as the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
In Babylonia also this alphabetic writing was in use
beside the cuneiform. We find it in Babylon side by
side with the corresponding cuneiform on a weight, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
which the inscription tells us: "Thirty min&aelig; of
standard weight: the palace of Irba Merodach (Marduk)
king of Babylon." The exact date of this king
cannot be ascertained: we only know that he must
have belonged to the old kingdom. Assyrian weights
with inscriptions in the Phenician alphabet, beside
the cuneiform inscriptions, are found of the eighth
century <small>B.C.</small>, the time of King Tiglath Pilesar II.,
Shalmanesar IV., and Sennacherib.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>"It can be maintained with good reason," says
Diodorus, "that the Chald&aelig;ans are far before all
other nations in their knowledge of the heavens; and
that they devoted the greatest attention and labour to
this science." At an early period, by comparing the
course of the sun with that of the moon, they had
perceived that the sun returned to the same position
after passing through about twelve cycles of the
moon; hence they fixed the year at twelve months of
thirty days, which they, by intercalations of various
kinds, brought into harmony with the astronomical
year of 365&frac14; days.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The observation, that the sun
after a course of twelve months returns to the same
constellation, led them on to determine the changing
position of the sun in the other months by constellations.
Thus the Babylonians marked off the
constellations which seemed to touch nearest upon
the course of the sun, and arrived at the signs of the
ecliptic or zodiac. Each of these twelve stations
through which the sun passed they again divided into
thirty parts. The week they fixed at seven days by the
course of the moon; to the day they allotted twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
hours, to correspond to the twelve months of the
year; the hours they divided into sixty parts, and
each of these sixtieths was again subdivided into sixty
parts. Their measures were also duodecimal. The
cubit was twenty-four finger-breadths; and on the
same system, their numerals were based upon the
<i>sossus</i>, or sixty,&mdash;a derivative from twelve, and the
<i>sarus</i>, or square of the <i>sossus</i>. When they attempted
to fix the position and intervals of the stars in the
sky, the basis taken for their measurements was the
diameter of the sun. They divided the daily course
of the sun, like the ecliptic, into 360 parts, and then
attempted to measure these at the equinox. At the
moment when the sun was seen in the sky on the
morning of the equinox, a jar filled with water was
opened. From this the water was allowed to run
into a second small jar, till the orb of the sun was
completely visible; then it ran into a third and larger
jar, till the sun was again seen on the horizon on the
following morning. They concluded that the diameter
of the sun must stand in the same proportion
to the cycle it passed through as the water in the
small jar stood to the water in the large one. Hence
they found that the diameter of the sun was contained
720 times in its course, and this diameter they fixed
at 1/30 of an hour.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The observation that an active
foot-courier could accomplish a certain distance in the
thirtieth part of an equinoctial hour, and thirty times
as much in the whole hour, supplied the Chald&aelig;ans
with a longitudinal measurement on the same basis.
The measure of the hour was the parasang (3/4 of a geographical
mile), and the thirtieth part of the parasang
was the stadium. Till we obtain help from the
inscriptions we must remain acquainted only with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Persian name of the first measure and the Greek name
of the second. At the equator the sun was supposed
in every hour to traverse a distance of thirty stadia.
On this system also the Chald&aelig;ans fixed the length of
their cubit. The stadium was divided into 360 cubits,
and the sixth part of the stadium, or plethron, into
sixty cubits, and the foot was fixed at 3/5 of this cubit.
Consequently the Babylonian cubit was fixed at
twenty-one inches of our measure (525 millimeters).<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>From this division of the sphere the Babylonians,
though aided by very simple instruments, the polus
and gnomon,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> arrived at very exact astronomical
observations and results. They discovered a period
of 223 months, within which all eclipses of the moon
occurred in a similar number and equal extent. By
means of this period they fixed the average length of
the synodic and periodic month with such accuracy
that our astronomers here found the first to be too
large by four seconds only, and the last by one
second. Their observations of ten lunar eclipses, and
three conjunctions of planets and fixed stars, have
come down to us. The oldest of these observations is
that of a lunar eclipse of the year 721 <small>B.C.</small>, which
took place "a good hour after midnight." The second
took place in 720 <small>B.C.</small>, "about midnight;" the third
in the same year "after the rising of the moon." In
these observations also our astronomers have found
but little to correct.</p>

<p>As the Chald&aelig;ans brought their measures of the
sphere, of time and length into correlation, so also
they attempted to preserve the same relation in
their cubic measures and weights. For their weights
and cubic measures the division of the units into
sixtieths (min&aelig;, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> parts) was retained. The quad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>rantal,
or <i>Maris</i>, contained one Babylonian cubic foot,
and the sixtieth part of this was the <i>Log</i>. The
weight in water of a Babylonian cubic foot was,
according to the statistics of our physicists, about
sixty-six pounds (32,721 kilogrammes), but the
Chald&aelig;ans reckoned it at only 60&#8535; pounds (30,300
kilogrammes).<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>The weight of the cubic measure was also the
standard for imperial weight in Babylonia. The
oldest weight which we know dates from the time
of Ilgi, king of Ur. The stone, which in shape is
not unlike a duck, has the inscription: "Ten min&aelig;
of Ilgi."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> There was a heavy talent (Kikkar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
"orb") arranged to weigh twice as much as the
quadrantal. Hence it weighed 121&#8533; pounds (60,600
kils.), and the sixtieth, or mina, weighed over two
pounds. The light talent weighed one quadrantal,
according to the estimate of the Chald&aelig;ans, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> 60&#8535;
pounds, and the mina was a little heavier than a
pound of our weight. But in weighing the precious
metals, the Chald&aelig;ans used units, which differed from
the imperial weights in use for all other purposes.
They calculated by little circular pieces, or rings, or
bars (tongues) of silver and gold, and the smallest of
these was equivalent to the shekel, or sixtieth part
of the mina of the heavy talent. These shekels were
the commonest and most indispensable measure of
value. It was found easier to reckon by units of
3,000 shekels, than by units of 3,600. And so it
came about that the mina contained fifty shekels
instead of sixty, and the talent 3,000 shekels instead
of 3,600. The three thousand shekels as a whole,
no longer weighed 121&#8533; pounds, but only 101<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
pounds, and the mina, or sixtieth part, instead of
weighing fully two pounds, weighed only about 1&#8535;
pounds.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>This weight, or the half of it (50&frac12; pounds), was
retained for the heavy and light gold talent. In the
weight of silver trade caused a further deviation. It
was necessary to exchange gold and silver, and in the
East in antiquity the value of gold and silver was
estimated at 13 : 1, or more accurately 13&#8531; : 1.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> By
making the silver shekel (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the fiftieth part of the
silver mina), which corresponded to the weight of
the light gold talent, a little heavier, a silver coin
was obtained which stood to the fiftieth of the light
gold mina, nearly in the ratio of 10 : 1. Ten silver
shekels of this weight could therefore without any
further trouble be exchanged for the fiftieth of the
gold mina, or gold shekel of the light gold talent.
Hence arose a silver talent of 67&#8531; pounds (33,660
kil.), a silver mina of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> pound, and a silver shekel
of about eleven milligrammes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE ART AND TRADE OF BABYLONIA.</h3>


<p>Like the Pharaohs, the rulers of Babylon sought
their fame in magnificent buildings. But their works
have not been able to withstand the ravages of time
with the same durability as the stone mountains and
porticoes on the Nile. The lower Euphrates does not
lie, like the Nile, between walls of rocks, from which
the most beautiful and hardest stone could be obtained.
The plain of Babylonia afforded nothing but earth
for the bricks, which were sometimes burnt, sometimes
dried in the sun; and excellent mortar was to be
obtained from the large asphalt pits on the Euphrates,
especially at Hit. Hence it was necessary to unite
the walls more strongly. In the palaces, and
temples, the walls of brick were covered with slabs
of gypsum, or limestone, which must often have been
brought from a distance, and these slabs were then
covered with sculptures, like the stone walls of the
Egyptian buildings. But more commonly the ornaments
on the inner walls, and occasionally even those
on the outer walls, consist of bricks coloured and
glazed. Though the material in Babylonia was
more fragile than the granite of Egypt, the extent,
scale, and splendour of these buildings were so great,
that remains even of the oldest have come down to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
our time. The upper portions of the brick walls have
fallen down, and the ruins of the Babylonian cities
have thus for the most part become unsightly enough;
but not the less do they point out the positions of the
old buildings, and under the heaps are hidden the most
valuable remains of those ancient periods.</p>

<p>As has been already remarked, the cities in the
south of Babylonia are the first to emerge in the
progress of the country. The oldest princes call
themselves kings of Ur and Nipur; they build at
Ur, at Nipur, at Erech, and at Senkereh, between
Erech and Ur. Not till the time of Hammurabi,
and perhaps through his power, did Babylon become
the centre and metropolis of the kingdom. He and
his successors built at Babylon, Borsippa, Sippara,
and Kutha, as well as in the southern cities. The
universal characteristic of these buildings, so far as
the remains allow us to pass any judgment, is the
extraordinary strength of the walls and the obvious
effort to obtain, by placing one story of solid masonry
upon another, higher positions, better air, and a more
extensive view in the level plain. The temples seem
almost universally to be built in this tower-like style,
either in order to be nearer the gods in the purer and
higher air, or because the gods, as spirits of the
heaven, and as bright luminaries of the sky, received
the sacrifices here offered to them, and the prayers
hence addressed to them with greater favour. On the
inside their structures were built of square bricks
three or four inches in thickness, and on the outside
these bricks are lined with burnt tiles. The tiles
almost invariably carry in the middle the impression
of the stamp of the king who used them.</p>

<p>The ruins of Ur (Mugheir), on the western bank of
the Euphrates, occupy a considerable space, shut in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
by the remains still traceable, of a wall, running
in an oval shape, and from three to four miles in
circumference. Amid these ruins rises, to the north-west,
a heap of bricks and broken tiles, which is even
now about 70 feet above the surface of the plain.
On a plateau about 20 feet in height is a rectangular
building, with the four sides directed exactly to the
four quarters of the sky. The two longer sides are
about 200 feet in length, the shorter sides are about
130 feet. It was a solid mass of brick, joined with
bitumen, about 27 feet high; the outer walls, of
burnt tiles, are about 10 feet thick. Buttresses of
eight feet in breadth surround the whole story at
short distances. The centre of the structure is pierced
by narrow air-passages extending from one side to
the other. On this story is a second, 120 feet in
length by 75 feet in breadth, and even now about
17 feet high. The ruins lying on this point to a
third story, which may have contained the actual
temple. There are traces still remaining of the
entrance, which led up from the outside. The tiles
of the lower story bear the stamp, "Urukh, king of
Ur, has erected the temple of the god Sin;" on
those of the upper story we find, "Ilgi, king of Ur,
king of Sumir, and Accad." This building was,
therefore, the temple of Sin, which Urukh commenced
and his son Ilgi continued and completed&mdash;a fact
which is further proved by the inscriptions of
Nabonetus, the last king of Babylon, which were
found in these ruins. To the south-east of this
structure lies a platform, faced with tiles, 400 feet
in circuit, which probably supported another temple
or a palace. The foundation walls of various
chambers can still be traced. Similar structures are
found in the ruins of Abu Shahrein, south of Mugheir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
on the Euphrates. From a wide platform rises a
square structure surrounded by a wall, in which are
the remains of decorated chambers. North of Ur, on
the east bank of the Euphrates, the remains of
Senkereh form a circular plateau, not quite five
miles in circumference; the ruins rise gradually
towards the centre, which is marked by the remains
of a structure 320 feet long and 220 broad, the walls
of which, on one side, still rise 70 feet over the plain.
In these and the other ruins of Senkereh inscriptions
are found in considerable numbers, which give us the
names of kings from Urukh to Cambyses.</p>

<p>In the ruins of Erech (Uruk, Warka), above Senkereh,
on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, are
found the remains of an outer wall, broken by
semicircular towers open to the city. This wall
forms an irregular circle of more than five miles in
circumference. Here and there the ruins are still
about 40 feet high. Within the wall are three heaps
of ruins. On the highest, which forms an exact square
of more than 200 feet at the base, we may trace the
ruins of a second story. This heap is about 100 feet
in height. It consists of bricks alternating with layers
of reeds at intervals of four or five feet in height.
Here also there are buttresses, in which the tiles are
cemented with bitumen. To the west lie the remains
of an oblong structure of double the size. The ruins
of Nipur are sixty miles to the north of Erech, in the
land between the Euphrates and the Tigris. Here are
several rounded heaps, but they are of less extent
than the remains of Ur, Senkereh, and Erech.</p>

<p>The heaps of ruins which rise out of the plains
some miles to the south-west of Babylon&mdash;the Arabs
call them Birs Nimrud, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the fortress of Nimrod"&mdash;exhibit
the same plan of structure as the ruins of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the temples at Ur and Erech. Within a square wall,
on a platform of brick, rises a square story, 272 feet
on every side, and 26 feet in height; over this is
a second story, of the same height, but forming a
square of 230 feet only, and not placed exactly in
the middle of the lower story, but in such a manner
that on one side it recedes 12 feet only, but on the
other 30 feet from the edge of the lower plateau.
In the same way the third and still smaller story
rests on the second. It is of the same height as the
others. The fourth story is only 15 feet in height.
The loose mass of ruins does not allow us to trace
any more stories. Hence the building in all probability
consisted of seven stories. It appears that
these ruins, like the extensive heaps of remains lying
to the east of them (Tel Ibrahim), mark the site of
the ancient Borsippa. The tiles of the stories, which
lie one over the other, bear the stamp of Nebuchadnezzar
II., and in the angles of the building cylinders
have been discovered,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> on which Nebuchadnezzar
relates that the temple of the seven lamps of the
earth, the tower of Borsippa, which an earlier king
had commenced but not completed, and which had
fallen into decay for many years, was again erected
by him, and the pinnacles covered with copper. In his
great inscription of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar further
tells us that he "restored the marvel of Borsippa, the
temple of the seven spheres of the sky and of the
earth, and covered the pinnacles with copper." In
the same inscription it is said that Nebuchadnezzar
built temples at Borsippa to the goddess Nana, to
Adar, Bin, and Sin, and that he restored and completed
Beth-Sida, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the chief temple of Nebo at
Borsippa; nevertheless we may be certain, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
cylinders actually found in the ruins, that the remains
are those of the temple of the seven lamps.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Turning from Borsippa to Babylon, we find Herodotus
describing the largest temple of the city in
the following manner:&mdash;"The sanctuary of Zeus
Belus&mdash;it is in existence still&mdash;forms a square of
two stadia on every side, and is furnished with iron
gates. In the midst is a massive tower, a stadium
in the square. Over this tower stands another, and
again another, till there are eight towers, one over the
other. They are ascended from the outside, and the
ascent goes up round all the towers. Half-way up
there is a resting-place, and seats for those who are
ascending. On the highest tower is a large temple,
and in the temple a large and beautifully-prepared
bed, and beside it a golden table. There is no
image there, nor does anyone watch there through
the night except a woman of the country, whom, as
the Chald&aelig;an priests say, their god has chosen out
of all the land. They also declare, though I do not
believe it, that the god sometimes comes into the
temple and rests on the bed. In this sanctuary there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
is also another temple below, and in this there is
a great image of the seated Zeus, of gold, and a large
golden table; the footstool and seat are also of gold;
and altogether, as the Chald&aelig;ans say, the amount of
gold used is 800 talents. Outside this temple is a
golden altar, on which only sucking creatures may
be sacrificed, and also a larger altar, where the full-grown
animals are sacrificed. On this the Chald&aelig;ans
burn in every year 1,000 talents of incense when
they celebrate the festival of the god. Here was
another golden image of the god, 12 cubits high.
But this I did not see; I only repeat what the
Chald&aelig;ans told me. This image Xerxes had taken
away. Such were the adornments of the temple,
and besides these there were in it many dedicatory
offerings given by individuals."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>Diodorus, who wrote four hundred years later than
Herodotus, relates:&mdash;"In the middle of the city was
the sanctuary of Zeus, whom the Babylonians call
Belus. But as the writers give different accounts
of the temple, and the structure has fallen from age,
it is not possible to say anything certain about it.
Yet they agree that it was extremely high, and that
the Chald&aelig;ans here made their observations of the
stars, as the height of the building enabled them to
observe accurately their rising and setting. The
whole building is said to have been constructed of
burnt brick and bitumen, with great skill and much
ornament. On the top were three statues of Zeus,
Hera, and Rhea, of beaten gold. The statue of Zeus
represented him standing and advancing. It was
40 feet high and 1,000 Babylonian talents in weight.
Of the same weight was the statue of Rhea, in which
the goddess was seated on a golden throne. Beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
her knees were two lions, and close at hand two very
large serpents of silver, each weighing 30 talents.
The standing figure of Hera weighed 800 talents;
in her right hand she held a serpent by the head, and
in the left a sceptre studded with precious stones.
Before these statues was a common table of beaten
gold, 40 feet long and 15 feet broad, and 500 talents
in weight. On the table were two chalices, each
30 talents in weight. There also were two vessels
for incense, each 30 talents in weight, and three
great jars, of which that consecrated to Zeus was
1,200 talents in weight, and the two others 600
talents each."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Strabo contents himself with the
remark: "The now ruined grave of Belus was a
square pyramid of burnt bricks. It was a stadium
in height, and a stadium on every side. Alexander
intended to rebuild it, but the work was enormous,
and required a long time; the removal of the debris
alone employed 10,000 workmen for two months, so
that he could not bring it to an end, for soon after he
fell sick and died."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> What Diodorus tells us of the
many thousand talents of gold, of the statues and
utensils on the top of the temple-tower, is borrowed
from Ctesias, and belongs to the romance or poetry
of the East from the time of the empire of the Medes.
But we cannot doubt that there was a considerable
amount of gold in the greatest sanctuary at Babel.
The seated image of gold in the lower temple, which
Herodotus saw, weighed, according to the Chald&aelig;ans,
800 talents, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, on the light imperial scale, 50,000
pounds.</p>

<p>It was this magnificent temple at Babylon to which
the tradition of the Hebrews has attached the account
of the building of that tower in the plain of Shinar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of which the top should reach heaven. The mighty
men, the giants of the ancient days, desired to climb
heaven. Their insolence and wicked purpose was
punished by the confusion of language and the
dispersion of mankind. Josephus makes Nimrod, as
the founder of the kingdom of Babylon, the promoter
of this wicked scheme. Nimrod intended the tower
to be so high that a second flood could not reach the
top, and thus men would be able to bid defiance to the
gods, and yet be secure against a second destruction.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Let us now inquire what conclusions, if any, can be
derived from the inscriptions about the great temple
of Babylon. From ancient times there was at this
place a sanctuary of the name of Beth-Sagall, or
Beth-Saggatu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "House of the Height." Whether
this was erected as early as Hammurabi is doubtful;
but an inscription of his successor tells us that he set
up the image of the god Merodach (Marduk) in Beth-Sagall.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
These inscriptions of king Esarhaddon, who
ruled over Assyria and Babylonia from 681 <small>B.C.</small> to
668 <small>B.C.</small>, tell us that "he caused tiles to be made in
Babylon for Beth-Saggatu, the temple of the great
gods."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> After the restoration of the Babylonian empire
Nebuchadnezzar always calls himself in his inscriptions,
"Supporter of Beth-Saggatu, and Beth-Sida."
Beth-Sida, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "House of Prosperity," or "House of
the Right Hand," was the name of the rich temple
of Nebo at Borsippa. "Like a pious man," says
Nebuchadnezzar in one of his inscriptions, "I have
dealt towards Beth-Saggatu, and towards Beth-Sida.
I have magnified the splendour of the god Merodach,
and the god Nebo, my lords: I have completed Beth-Sida,
the eternal house, where Nebo and Nana are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
enthroned, at Borsippa."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> "I have set up Beth-Saggatu,
and beautified it; Beth-Sida I have completed."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> On
the cylinders found in the ruins of the temple of the
seven lamps, Nebuchadnezzar says: "Beth-Saggatu is
the temple of the Heaven and the Earth, the dwelling
of Merodach, the lord of the gods, and with pure
gold have I caused the temple to be covered, where
his splendour rests; the temple of the foundations of
the earth, the tower of Babylon, I have restored, with
tiles and copper I have completed it, and raised its
summit."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The chief inscription on the stone of
black basalt relates at greater length how Nebuchadnezzar
adorned the sanctuary in Beth-Saggatu, where
Merodach rested; how he set up the marvel of
Babylon, the temple of the foundations of the heaven
and the earth; how he raised the summit with tiles
and copper. The description of this erection concludes
with the satisfaction felt in seeing that Beth-Saggatu
was now completed.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> And not only does Nebuchadnezzar
boast of the care and attention bestowed by
him on Beth-Sida and Beth-Saggatu. The prince
before whose arms the creation of Nebuchadnezzar,
the restored kingdom of Babylon, was overthrown&mdash;Cyrus,
the Persian, calls himself on the stamp of a
tile at Senkereh, "Kuru, supporter of Beth-Saggatu
and Beth-Sida, son of Kambuzija."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>This series of evidence shows that the lofty temple
of Belus, which Herodotus has described for us above,
was to the Babylonians "the House of the Height,"
the temple of Bel Merodach (<a href="#Page_268">p. 268</a>), and that it was
the first of the three temples in which the kings of
Assyria sacrificed when they trod the soil of Babylon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
at the head of their victorious armies, or as sovereigns;
and that of these three rich temples, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the temple of
Nergal at Kutha, Beth-Sida, the temple of Nebo at
Borsippa, and Beth-Saggatu, the temple of Merodach
at Babel, the latter was certainly the most wealthy.
Moreover, the inscriptions show that the foundation
goes back as far as the times of king Hammurabi,
whose accession we found it possible&mdash;on hypothesis
only, it is true&mdash;to place in the year 1976 <small>B.C.</small> But
even the Hebrew narrative of the building of the
Tower of Babel, which must have been written down
before 1,000 <small>B.C.</small> (below, chap. vii.) proves, in this
respect harmonising with the inscriptions, that long
before this time there must have been in Babylon a
structure of great height, but unfinished.</p>

<p>Herodotus, in his description of Babylon, tells us
that the Tower of Belus was on one side of the
Euphrates, and the royal castle on the other. On
which side each of these lay, he does not state.
Xenophon speaks of the palace of Babylon, and beside
this of special castles.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> From the accounts of those
who accompanied Alexander, it is clear that there
were two royal castles in Babylon, one on the right
hand and one on the left of the Euphrates, which
certainly were not built under the Ach&aelig;menids.
Berosus tells us that Nebuchadnezzar built himself a
palace beside that of his father Nabopolassar. The
inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar speak repeatedly of
the continuation of the palace at Babylon which his
father had begun.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> As the two great heaps of
ruins on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, El Kasr
and Amran ibn Ali, exhibit on the tiles found there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the stamp of Nebuchadnezzar, this palace of the ruler
of the restored kingdom must have lain on the east
bank of the Euphrates. Diodorus describes the two
castles of Babylon, of which one was on the east and
the other on the west bank of the river; while both
were adorned with various ornaments. "That in the
part lying towards the west" had a circuit of sixty
stades, inclosed by lofty and costly walls. These
were followed by a second circular wall, on the rude
bricks of which various kinds of animals were
stamped, and brought into a resemblance with the
reality by the painter's art. The circumference was
forty stades in length, and the wall was three hundred
bricks in thickness; the height, according to Ctesias,
was fifty fathoms, and the tower rose to sixty
fathoms. The third interior wall which surrounded
the buildings was twenty stades in circuit, but in
height and thickness it surpassed the middle wall.
On this and the towers belonging to it animals of
all kinds were depicted with considerable skill in
form and colour. The whole exhibited a chase, full
of many different animals, which were of more than
four cubits in size. Among these was a queen on
horseback, who threw her dart at a panther; and at
hand was the king, who thrust at a lion with his lance.
This palace surpassed both in size and beauty the
palace on the other side of the Euphrates. Here the
exterior wall of burnt tiles was only thirty stades in
circumference, and instead of the numerous animals
were bronze statues of a king and a queen and of
governors, and also a bronze statue of Zeus, whom
the Babylonians call Belus. But in the interior were
military evolutions and hunting scenes of every kind,
which gave varied amusement to the spectator.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Ctesias, whom Diodorus followed in his description
of the palace on the west bank, as in his account of
the treasures in the Tower of Belus (<a href="#Page_293">p. 293</a>), has also
borrowed, in his description of this castle, the erection
of which he ascribes to Ninus, from the Medo-Persian
Epos, and this, as I shall show below, endeavoured
to place the glory of Ninus and Semiramis in the
most brilliant light. Hence, though here, as in
the account of the treasures, considerable deductions
are to be made, we can nevertheless recognise the
fact that the castle of the ancient kings of Babylon on
the western bank of the Euphrates was of considerable
size, magnificent, and well fortified, although the
remains now in existence are fewer and far smaller than
those of the palace of Nebuchadnezzar on the eastern
bank of the Euphrates, where the painted and glazed
tiles also confirm what Diodorus says of the battle
and hunting scenes of this palace. If the ancient
royal castle lay on the western bank, the Tower of
Belus rose opposite it on the eastern bank. This is
proved by an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, in which
we are told:&mdash;"In order to protect Beth-Saggatu more
strongly, and secure it from the attack of the enemy,
I have erected a second wall, the wall of the rising
sun, which no king had built before me."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Hence we
may with certainty affirm that the most northern of
the heaps on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, the
heap of Babil, the summit of which still rises 140
feet above the river, is the remains of the great
tower of Bel Merodach.</p>

<p>The ancient kings of Babylon, Hammurabi and
his successors, not only built temples and palaces,
but also fortresses. Hammurabi has himself already
told us, that he built the fortress of Ummubanit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
"the towers of which were as high as mountains."
Kurigalzu built the fortress of this name (Akerkuf,
<a href="#Page_262">p. 262</a>). Of the extensive walls of Ur and Erech
we have already spoken, and Sennacherib could boast
of having taken eighty-nine fortresses in Babylonia
(<a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>).</p>

<p>Herodotus observes that in Babylonia the river
(Euphrates) does not overflow into the fields spontaneously,
as in Egypt. It is not so active as the
Nile, and the water has to be raised artificially by
hand, and by wheels.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The provision of a sufficient
supply of water for the land was not neglected by
the kings. We have already seen (<a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>) that
king Hammurabi boasted to have supplied Sumir
and Accad with water for ever. The canal system
of Babylonia began about 150 miles above the metropolis.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
The main object was to protect the plain
from the rapid floods of the Euphrates by dams, and
to moderate the flow of the inundation. Reservoirs
were required to receive the water of the overflow,
and preserve it against the time of drought. It was
also necessary to carry the water as far as the middle
of the plain, which in ordinary years it failed to
reach, to form a network of canals to convey water
from the Euphrates even when there was no inundation,
and finally to dig trenches to remove the
water from districts where it lay too long, and to
drain the broad marshes on the lower river near
the mouth of the Euphrates. From the inscription
of Hammurabi, and the numerous remains of
dams and canals, we may conclude that the kings
of Babylon constructed large and comprehensive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
works of this kind, which were of use not in agriculture
only, but for commerce also. The brief
duration of the later restoration of the kingdom
could not allow time to complete the greater part
of the vast structures and conduits, of which traces
and ruins are still in existence. The canal Naarsares,
which was carried from the Euphrates above Babylon
toward the west, and ran parallel to the stream till
within a short distance of the mouth; the canal
Pallakopas, which was derived from the main stream
100 miles below Babylon, and emptied into the
Chald&aelig;an lakes, in order to convey to them the
excess of water from the Euphrates; and three
junction canals above Babylon between the Euphrates
and Tigris, from which trenches branched
off for irrigation, appear to belong to the time of
the ancient kingdom (see below). These labours of
the princes, the numerous dams and "waters of
Babylon," attained their object. Babylonia was a
garden where the land brought forth more abundant
fruits than in Egypt.</p>

<p>Very few relics are left of the sculpture of the
Babylonians. If we set aside a few sketches on
cylinders and seals, we have no means of knowing
at first hand the images of their gods. The form
of the god Nebo on the cylinder of Urukh has been
already mentioned (<a href="#Page_260">p. 260</a>). The finished statues
cannot have been very different from the images of
the Assyrian gods and the statues of Nebo (<a href="#Page_267">p. 267</a>).
The remains of the ornaments of the friezes in the
palaces of Babylon are scarcely to be distinguished
from Assyrian sculptures. They are bearded, long-haired
heads of serious expression, with tall, upright
headdresses. Beyond these only a few figures in
clay have been preserved, which are not without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
a certain truth of nature, though exaggerated, and
a rude though powerful lion of stone standing over
a prostrate man, from the ruins of Babylon. Whether
we regard it as unfinished, or as belonging to the
infancy of art, this work is all that we possess of
full figures in stone, except a duck, intended for
use as a weight (<a href="#Page_282">p. 282</a>). The human forms on
the numerous seal cylinders are often sketched in
rude, childish outlines. On the other hand, the
single relief of a king of Babylon hitherto discovered,
though massive, is of artistic and neat workmanship.
The king wears a long and very richly-adorned robe
with close sleeves, which are fastened by bracelets
round the knuckles. The robe reaches to the ankles,
over which come the richly embroidered shoes. The
head is covered by a tall, upright tiara, on which are
horses with wings and horns. The king has a bow
in his left hand, and two arrows in his right; in his
girdle is a dagger. It appears to be an image of
Mardukidinakh, the opponent of Tiglath Pilesar I.
of Assyria (<a href="#Page_262">p. 262</a>). The forms of the animals in the
reliefs, and the cylinders, are lively in conception and
vigorous in workmanship; they consist of dogs, birds,
apes, deer, and antelopes. Humorous sketches of
animals in caricature are also found on cylinders,
and the earrings and ornaments, found in the ruins,
are, in part, of delicate workmanship.</p>

<p>The most remarkable remains in the ruins of Ur
and Erech are the tombs. At Ur, outside the
wall already mentioned, there is a broad band of
sepulchres encircling the ruins of the wall. The
tombs are chambers of seven feet in length, three
to four feet in breadth, and five feet in height. The
roofs are formed by tiles projecting in successive
layers over the walls, and thus gradually approaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
each other. The floors are also covered with tiles.
On the tiles lay a mat of reeds, and on this the
corpse was placed, generally turned to the left side,
with the head on a brick; the right arm, laid towards
the left over the breast, rests the fingers on the edge
of a copper saucer. Clay vessels for food and drink
are found on the walls. In the ruins of Erech the
whole space between the three prominent heaps of
ruins and the external walls is filled with tombs,
bones, and relics of the dead. The coffins here are
receptacles partly oval, made of burnt clay in a
single piece, about seven feet long, two and a half
broad, and two to three feet high, contracting towards
the top; and partly narrow funnel-shaped vessels of
clay rounded off at both ends and united in the
middle, in which the body was closely fitted. The
position of the skeletons and objects round them
are the same in the oval coffins as in the brick vaults.
As a rule these coffins are not found under the
surface, but in raised brick buildings. They lie
thickly together, and often in several rows, one upon
the other. Relics of weapons, necklaces, and bracelets,
gold and silver rings for the fingers and toes, and
other ornaments, are found in these sepulchres.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The industry of the Babylonians quickly attained
great skill and wide development. They were famous
for their weaving in wool and linen. The nations of
the West agree in acknowledging the excellence of
the cloths and coloured stuffs of Babylonia. Their
pottery was excellent and the manufacture active;
the preparation of glass was not unknown; the
ointments prepared in Babylon were famous and
much sought after, and the stones cut there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
highly valued. The products of Babylonian skill
and industry were first brought to their kinsmen
in Syria, who could offer oil and wine in exchange.
In the Hebrew scriptures we find Babylonian cloaks
in use in Syria before the immigration of the Hebrews
into Canaan.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> How active the commerce between
Babylonia and Syria was even before that date is
proved by the circumstance that the tribute which
in the sixteenth century <small>B.C.</small> was received by
Tuthmosis III. from Syria is put down on the
inscriptions at Karnak (<a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>) in part in weight
by the mina, and in part, when reduced from the
Egyptian to the Babylonian weight, gives round
sums corresponding to the Babylonian weight, from
which the conclusion can be drawn that the imperial
Babylonian weight and the Babylonian money
weight were already in use in Syria about this time.
That the trade mina of the Syrians was the sixtieth
part of the heavy (weight) talent of the Babylonians
is ascertained; but the heavy and light gold talent,
as well as the silver talent of 67&#8531; pounds, must,
according to these deductions, have been known to
the Syrians about this date.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Afterwards the Hebrews
put their gold shekel, on the basis of the heavy gold
talent of Babylon, at the fiftieth part of the mina
of this talent. Besides the silver talent of Babylonia,
there was also a heavy silver talent of about ninety
pounds (44,760 kil.) in use in Syria. This came
into existence because in Syria fifteen, and not ten,
silver pieces (fiftieths of the mina) were equal to
the fiftieth of the heavy gold mina (1&#8535; pounds),
(<a href="#Page_285">p. 285</a>).<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Along with their weights the Syrians also
adopted the cubic measures of the Babylonians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>The rough material required by Babylonian industry
was supplied in the first place by the Arabs, who
exchanged their animals, skins, and wool for corn
and weapons. Wine, and more especially wood,
of which there was none in Babylonia, were brought
by the Armenians from their valleys in the north
down the Euphrates to Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Before 1500 <small>B.C.</small>
the commerce of the Arabs brought the products
of South Arabia, the spices of Yemen, and even the
products and manufactures of India, especially their
silks, which reached the coasts of Southern Arabia
(see below), to Babylon. The Babylonians required
the perfumes of Arabia and India to prepare their
ointments. In order to prepare the best or royal
ointment, twenty-five of the most precious perfumes
were mixed together.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> When the cities of Phenicia
became great centres of trade which carried the wares
of Babylonia by sea to the West in order to obtain
copper in exchange, the trade between Babylonia and
Syria must have become more lively still. It was
the ships of the Phenicians which brought the cubic
measure, and the weights, and the cubit of Babylonia
to the shores of Greece, and caused them to be adopted
there. In the ninth or eighth century <small>B.C.</small> the Greeks
completely dropped their old measures of length and
superficies, and fixed their stadium at 360 Babylonian
cubits, their plethrum at the length and the square
of sixty Babylonian cubits, and regulated the Greek
foot by the Babylonian at a measure from 308 to
315 millimeters, and made their cubit equal to one
and a half of these feet.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The light Babylonian
talent became known in Greece under the name of
the Eub&#339;ic talent, while the Greek city Phoc&aelig;a, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the shores of Asia Minor, struck the oldest Greek
coin, the Phoc&aelig;an stater, at the value of a fiftieth
of the heavy gold mina of Babylon (1&#8535; pounds).
Chios, Clazomen&aelig;, and Lampsacus followed the heavy
Syrian silver talent in their coinage; and lastly,
Cr&#339;sus made his gold stater equal to the fiftieth
part of the mina of the light Babylonian gold talent
(50&frac12; pounds), and his silver stater equal to the
fiftieth part of the mina of the Babylonian silver
talent of 67&#8531; pounds.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

Borsippa is contradicted by the inscriptions. The measurements of the
temple give no support for such a theory, even if the forty-two cubits of
the cylinders of Rawlinson are interpreted with Norris, "Dict." p. 280,
by Amatgagar; for we do not know the value of this measure exactly. I
cannot regard Borsippa as a part of Babylon in the teeth of the direct
testimony of Strabo (p. 728), Justin (12, 13), and Ptolemy (5, 20). The
inscriptions of the Assyrians, and, not least, those of Nebuchadnezzar
himself, always mention Borsippa beside Babylon. If it be maintained
that in spite of this Nebuchadnezzar might have included Borsippa in
the walls of Babylon, the theory is contradicted by Berosus (Joseph,
"c. Apion." 1, 20), according to whom Cyrus besieges and takes Babylon
while Nabonetus is blocked up in Borsippa, and by Nebuchadnezzar
himself, who, after speaking of the great walls of Babylon, adds:&mdash;"I
also laid the foundations of the walls of Borsippa, the Tabi-subur-su"
(M&eacute;nant, "Babylone," p. 205).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE ARABS.</h3>


<p>The Arabian peninsula is a repetition of Africa on
a smaller scale and in more moderate proportions, without
a river-valley like that of the Nile. The centre
is occupied by a table-land, which presents a few
well-watered depressions lying under a burning sky
between naked deserts, plains of sand, cliffs, and bald
peaks. Thus, in spite of the great extent of the
country (more than 1,000,000 square miles), there are
few districts in the interior of Arabia suitable for
agriculture. But towards the south, on the Indian
Ocean, the plateau sinks down to the sea in broad
mountain terraces. Here are extremely fertile valleys,
and the most valuable fruits grow on the terraces in
the tropic atmosphere, which is cooled by the elevation
of the mountains and the winds blowing from the
ocean. This is the land of frankincense, of the sugarcane
and coffee-tree, of pomegranates, figs, and dates,
of wheat and maize.</p>

<p>Herodotus, who follows all antiquity in extending
the name Arabia to the deserts of Syria and Sinai,
gives us but few notices of the inhabitants of this
wide district. "The Arabs," he tells us, "wear long
garments, and on the right side carry large bows,
which can be strung on either side, and travel on
swift camels. They have only two gods&mdash;Dionysus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
whom they call Urotal; and Urania, whom they call
Alilat. Urania is known to the Babylonians as Mylitta,
to the Arabs as Alilat. Bargains are struck in the
following manner. A third person makes an incision
in the hand near the thumb of each of the two persons
who wish to enter into the compact, and with the
blood he smears seven stones lying between them;
calling at the same time on Urotal and Alilat. These
compacts are observed with a sanctity unknown to any
other nation."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Eratosthenes tells us that the Arab
tribes lying next to the Syrians and Jews were agricultural,
but beyond them lay a sandy and poor soil,
with nothing but a few palms, acacias, tamarisks, and
wells of water. This district, as far as the Euphrates,
was inhabited by the Nabat&aelig;ans, Agr&aelig;ans, and
Chaulot&aelig;ans, tribes who kept camels and lived in
tents.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Artemidorus of Ephesus calls Arabia rich
in cattle, lions, panthers, wolves, wild asses, and
camels; the inhabitants were wandering herdmen,
who gained a subsistence from their camels; on them
they rode, from them they fought, and on their milk
and flesh they lived. The names of the Arabian tribes
he is unwilling to mention, because of their insignificance
and harsh sound.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Diodorus also tells us that
the inhabitants of the part of Arabia towards Syria
lived by agriculture and trade, but with the Nabat&aelig;ans
the land began to be arid and barren; and they
led the life of robbers, plundering their neighbours far
and wide; no one had succeeded in conquering them.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
The interior of Arabia, and the western side, were
occupied by plains of sand of enormous extent. On
these it was only possible to travel as on the sea, by
taking the Great Bear as a guide. In the whole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the interior there were no cities, but only dwellers in
tents, and the most part of the Arabian tribes led a
nomadic life, for Arabia was very rich in animals of
various kinds, so that the Arabs could easily live on
them without cultivating corn. They had large herds
of cattle, and with these they wandered over immeasurable
plains. In conclusion, Diodorus praises the fertility
and beauty of a well-watered palm-grove in the
peninsula between the northern bays of the Arabian
Sea, which the barbarians had very justly consecrated
to the gods, as it lay in the midst of a very hot and
desert land, surrounded by a wilderness. There was an
old altar there of hard stone inscribed with very ancient
letters, which no one could read. A man and woman
presided for life as priests over this holy palm-grove,
and every four years the neighbouring Arab tribes sacrificed
hecatombs of goodly camels there.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Pliny observes:
"Strange to say, the Arabs live about equally
on plunder and on trade; what they get from their
forests (by which is meant the products of the date-palms
and the fruit-trees of South Arabia) and from
the sea they sell; but they purchase nothing in
return."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> "The Arabs," says Ammianus Marcellinus,
"extend from the Euphrates to Egypt. They are half-naked,
with only a coloured apron round the body
reaching to the middle. Every man is a warrior. On
their swift fine-limbed horses and their camels they
ride in every direction. They do not continue long
in any one place: without settled abodes they wander
to and fro, and their whole life is nothing but a flight.
Of bread and wine the most part of them know nothing
whatever."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the southern coasts of Arabia the accounts are
different. It is a remark of Herodotus that the fairest
blessings are allotted to the extreme limits of the
earth; and among other places to Arabia, the southern
extremity of the inhabited world. Here only, in all
the earth, grow frankincense, myrrh, cassia, and
ladanum; here are sheep with such thick tails, that
carriages have to be fastened behind them. But the
frankincense trees are watched by winged serpents, and
the cassia by bats. Cinnamon does not grow in Arabia,
but large carnivorous birds of prey brought branches
of cinnamon for their nests,&mdash;from which direction
the Arabs could not tell.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Heraclides of Cyme gave
an account of the wealth of the king of the land of
frankincense. He pretended to know that the expenses
for the king, his wife, and friends, amounted each day
to the sum of fifteen Babylonian talents. Living an
effeminate and luxurious life, he always remained in
the palace; he did nothing, and was never seen by the
people; but if anyone went into the palace to complain
of a decision at law, the king himself passed
sentence.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Through the trade connection of Alexandria
Eratosthenes obtained better information on these
districts, and was enabled to mention the tribes who
possessed the south. "In the extreme end of Arabia
next the sea dwell the Min&aelig;ans, whose metropolis is
Karna; after these come the Sab&aelig;ans, whose metropolis
is Mariaba; further to the west, as far as the
corner of the Arabian Gulf, are the Cattabani, whose
kings dwell at Thamna; finally, the Chatramites are
furthest to the east, and their city is Sabbatha. Each
of these four districts is larger than the Delta of
Egypt; they have rain in the summer, and rivers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
which lose themselves in the plains and lakes. Hence
the land is so fruitful that seed is sown twice in the
year. The land of the Cattabani supplies incense, the
Chatramites produce myrrh; but elsewhere also fruits
of every kind are plentiful and cattle abundant. From
the Chatramites it is a journey of forty days to the
Sab&aelig;ans; from the Min&aelig;ans the merchants go in
seventy days to Aela (Elath). The cities of the
Chatramites, Cattabani, Sab&aelig;ans, and Min&aelig;ans are
rich, and adorned with temples and royal palaces."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
The Sab&aelig;ans, the most numerous tribe of Arabia,
according to Agatharchides, who wrote in the second
half of the second century <small>B.C.</small>, inhabited the so-called
Arabia Felix. Here grew the most beautiful fruits
without number; here was an inexhaustible abundance
of animals of every kind. In the strips of land
by the sea grew balsam and cassia, and another plant
most beautiful to the eye. In the interior were thick
forests of tall frankincense and myrrh-trees, and also
cinnamon-trees, palm and calmus, and trees of a
similar kind, which, like the others, send forth the
sweetest odour. Owing to the innumerable multitude,
it is not possible to name and describe every
species. The perfume is divine and beyond all words.
Even those who go past on the coast, at a distance
from the land, enjoy this perfume, if the wind is
blowing off shore. For there the spices are not cut
and old and stored up, but in fresh vigour and bloom,
so that those who sail along the coast believe that
they are enjoying ambrosia, since no other word can
express the extraordinary power and strength of the
odour. The monarchy among the Sab&aelig;ans is hereditary.
Their chief city, Mariaba, lies on a mountain;
here lives the king, who pronounces justice for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
people, but he is never allowed to leave his palace.
If he acts otherwise, he is stoned by the people, in
obedience to an ancient oracle. The Sab&aelig;ans are
the richest people in the world. For a few goods
silver and gold are brought in quantities, and flow in
from every side; while, owing to their remote situation,
they have never been conquered by any one.
Hence, especially in the metropolis, they have a
number of vessels of silver and gold and couches, and
porticoes, the pillars of which are gilded in the shaft,
and the capitals are adorned with silver ornaments,
while the architraves and doors are finished with gold
and precious stones. On these structures they bestow
great care and industry.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Artemidorus of Ephesus,
who wrote somewhat later than Agatharchides of
Cnidus, represents the king of the Sab&aelig;ans and his
court as living at Mariaba, which lay on a wooded
mountain, in effeminate luxury. Owing to the abundance
of fruit the people were lazy and inactive, and
reclined on the roots of the spice-trees. For fire-wood
they used cinnamon and cassia. The occupation of
the people was partly agriculture, and partly trade in
spices, both native and imported from the opposite
coast of &AElig;thiopia (Africa), whither the Sab&aelig;ans passed
over the inlet of the sea in boats of skins. The neighbouring
tribes received the wares from the Sab&aelig;ans,
and then passed them on to their neighbours, till they
reached Syria and Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Pliny tells us that
the Sab&aelig;ans were the most famous of the Arabians,
owing to their frankincense, and their land reached
from sea to sea. Their cities lay on the sea and in
the interior, the chief city being Mariaba. One portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of the Sab&aelig;ans were called the Chatramites, and their
chief city, Sabbatha, had sixty temples within its walls;
further to the east were the Cattabani, whose city,
Thamna, could enumerate sixty-five temples. The
Min&aelig;ans lay in the interior beyond the Chatramites.
The frankincense was collected and brought to Sabbatha,
and could not be purchased and taken away
by strangers till the priests had set apart a tenth for
the god of Sabbatha. The only passage for exportation
was through the land of the Cattabani, to the
king of which imposts had to be paid. The priests
also and the scribes of the king received presents,
and the doorkeepers, bodyguard, and escort. Thamna,
the chief city of the Cattabani, was distant seventy-five
days' journey from Gaza. And as payments had
to be made, at one place for pasturage, at another for
water, at a third for the stage, and again for the convoy,
the cost for each camel as far as the Syrian desert
amounted to 688 denarii.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>According to the Hebrew Scriptures the Sheba,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Sab&aelig;ans, "a distant people, rich in frankincense,
spices, gold, and precious stones," were to be
sought in the south of Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The tribe or locality
of Uzal, which Genesis and Ezekiel mention beside the
Sab&aelig;ans, is the older name of the later Sanaa. The
chief city of the Sab&aelig;ans, which Western writers call
Mariaba, is the Maryab of the inscriptions. To the
east of the Sab&aelig;ans, on the south coast, were situated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the Hazarmaweth of the Hebrews, the Chatramites of
the Western nations, in the district of Hadramaut,
which still preserves the name. The Rhegm&aelig;ans of
the Western nations, the sons of Rama among the
Hebrews, are to be sought in the neighbourhood of
the Persian Gulf, in Oman, the south-east of Arabia.
Further to the north-east, on the shore of this Gulf,
were the Dedanites; and yet further to the north-east
the Havila appear to have dwelt, who are perhaps
the Chaulot&aelig;ans, whom Eratosthenes places towards
the Lower Euphrates. The Hebrew Scriptures repeatedly
mention the Hagarites, the Nebajoth (the
Agr&aelig;ans and Nabat&aelig;ans of Eratosthenes), and further
towards the interior of Arabia the Kedarites and
Temanites; and lastly, on the peninsula of Sinai, and
on the borders of Canaan, the Amalekites, Edomites,
and Midianites. The Hebrews mention two chiefs
of the Midianites, whose names were "Wolf" and
"Raven," the leather tents of this people, the number
of their dromedaries, and the moons which their
camels carried as ornaments. Next are mentioned
the flocks of the Nebajoth, the black tents of the
Kedarites, their wealth in cattle (large and small),
and their brave bowmen.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The inscriptions of Egypt from the time of the
Tuthmosis and the first Ramses celebrate achievements
performed, as it is said, by these Pharaohs
against the Punt, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> against the Arabs; but with
one exception, they do not supply any information of
the land and the tribes of this people. A daughter of
Tuthmosis I., queen Misphra (Hatasu, Ramake), who
was regent first for her brother Tuthmosis II., and
during a considerable time for Tuthmosis III. (1625-1591
<small>B.C.</small>), wished to become acquainted with "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
land of Punt, as far as the uttermost end of To-Neter."
She equipped a fleet on the Red Sea, and led
it in person to the coast of Arabia. The inhabitants
of the coast on which she landed submitted, and she
returned to Egypt with rich spoil, in which were
thirty-two spice-trees.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> The inscriptions of the kings
of Asshur supply further information: among the tribes
of the Arabians they mention in the first place the
Pekod, the Hagarites, whom they place in the neighbourhood
of the lands of Hauran, Moab and Zoba,
the Kedarites, Thamudenes, Nabat&aelig;ans, and finally
the Sab&aelig;ans. The Hebrew Scriptures bring the queen
of Sheba to Solomon at Jerusalem, and represent her
as offering rich presents in gold and frankincense, and
similarly Tiglath-Pilesar II., king of Assyria, tells us
that in the year 738 <small>B.C.</small> he had received tribute from
Zabibieh, the queen of Arabia (Aribi), and in the year
734 <small>B.C.</small> he had taken from Samsieh, queen of the Arabs,
30,000 camels and 20,000 oxen, and further, that
he had subjugated the people of Saba, the city of
the Sab&aelig;ans. Sargon boasts that he had subdued
the people of Thammud (the Thamudenes), Tasid,
Ibadid, Marsiman, Chayapa, the distant Arb&aelig;ans, and
the inhabitants of the land of Bari, "which was
unknown to the learned and to the scribes," and that
he received the tribute of Samsieh, queen of the
Arabs, and of Yathamir, the Sab&aelig;an (Sabahi) in gold,
spices, and camels (in the year 715 <small>B.C.</small>). He mentions
the land of Agag, "on the borders of the Arabs
toward the rising sun," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Eastern Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> King
Sennacherib took from the Pekod, the Hagarites,
Nabat&aelig;ans, and some other tribes, 5,330 camels and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
800,600 head of small cattle (703 <small>B.C.</small>), and in the
time of Assurbanipal (about 645 <small>B.C.</small>) Adiya, the
queen of the Arabs, and Ammuladin, the king of the
Kedarites, were brought in chains to Nineveh; the
"innumerable troops" of another prince, Uaiti, were
defeated and his tents burnt. Abiyateh also, who was
leagued against Assyria, first with Uaiti, and then
with Nadnu (Nathan), the king of the Nabat&aelig;ans,
was conquered, together with these allies, and the
worshippers of Atar Samain (Istar). Assurbanipal tells
us that out of the booty of this campaign he distributed
camels like sheep, and that at the gate of
Nineveh camels had been sold for half a silver shekel
(from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>).<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The position of Arabia, between the valleys of the
Nile and the Euphrates and Tigris, where agriculture
and civilisation came into bloom at an early period,
and which were the oldest seats of trade and industry,
brought the Arab tribes who wandered along the
borders of these river valleys into connection with
Egypt and Babylon. Barter had to supply all that
could not be obtained by freebooting. The nomads
required corn, implements, and weapons; Egypt and
Babylon were in need of horses, sheep, goats, and
camels. The Arabians, therefore, could exchange
their animals for corn, weapons, and implements, and
supply the industry of Babylon and Egypt with a
part of the necessary raw products, more especially
skins and wool. The tradition of the Hebrews represents
Abraham as going to Egypt, and the sons of
Jacob buy corn in Egypt when "there was a famine
in the land." On the other hand, Egypt, as has been
already remarked, had already, under Snefru, the predecessor
of Chufu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about the year 3000 <small>B.C.</small>, fixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
herself in the peninsula of Sinai, and when, a thousand
years later, nomad tribes of the north-west of Arabia
obtained the supremacy in the valley of the Nile, and
maintained it for centuries (<a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>), their supremacy
could only develop further the trade between Egypt
and the Arabs, between the ruling tribe in Egypt and
their kinsmen at home, and thus the contact with the
civilisation of Egypt and Babylonia was not without
effect on the Arabs. This contact increased their
wants, and therefore increased their trading intercourse.
The Arabs could offer not merely the
products of their herds, they could exchange the
costly spices and perfumes from the southern coast
of their land with each other, and so convey them to
the Egyptians and Babylonians. The Hebrew Scriptures
make Keturah, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "Incense," the wife of
Abraham, and from this connection spring the
Midianites and the Dedanites; to Esau, the son of
Isaac, the progenitor of the Edomites, they give a
wife of the name of Basmath, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "Perfume,"<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> and in
the twentieth century <small>B.C.</small>, according to their reckoning,
we find a caravan of Ishmaelites, with camels, carrying
spices, balsam, and ladanum, and Midianites going
for purposes of trade to Egypt.</p>

<p>The trade of Egypt and Babylonia with the south of
Arabia, through the medium of the Arab tribes,
certainly goes back to the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, if the
attempt was made in Egypt about the year 1600 <small>B.C.</small>
to reduce Southern Arabia. Not long after his campaigns
in Syria and Mesopotamia, Tuthmosis III. imposed
on the Syrians a tribute of 828 min&aelig;, and on the
Naharina a tribute of 81 min&aelig; of spices;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> hence such
spices must not only have found their way into these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
districts at this time, but must have been already
known as ordinary articles of trade. How strongly
Egypt felt her need of the products of South Arabia
is most strikingly shown by the fact that the
Egyptians were very anxious to obtain these products
by the direct route over the Arabian Gulf; the canal
which Ramses II. began to make towards the gulf
(<a href="#Page_146">p. 146</a>) could have no other object in view than to
facilitate the communication between the Nile and the
coast of South Arabia and East Africa, by the Red Sea.
Under Ramses III. (1269-1244 <small>B.C.</small>) a great fleet is
said to have sailed for a second time to To-Neter, and
to have returned to Coptus with the tribute of these
lands and a rich freight.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The need of incense was
not less in Babylon than in Egypt. We saw that the
preparation of ointments was a main branch of
Babylonian industry, and Herodotus tells us that at
the feast of Belus, at Babylon, a thousand talents of
incense, which according to the light Babylonian
weight is more than 60,000 pounds, was burnt on
the altar of the great temple. As the Temanites,
Kedarites, Nebajoth, and Midianites formed the
medium of trade between South Arabia and Egypt, so
were the Rhegm&aelig;ans and Dedanites the communicating
link between South Arabia and Babylonia. Among
the Sab&aelig;ans the Babylonian talent was current.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>This carrying trade between South Arabia, Egypt,
Syria, and Mesopotamia must have increased when
the cities of the Phenicians on the Syrian coast
became centres of trade which carried the manufactures
of Babylonia, as well as the products of their
own industry, over the sea to the West, and when the
tribes of Greece and Italy began to desire the incense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
and spices of Arabia. And it was not only the
products of South Arabia which the Arabs brought
to Syria, Egypt, and Babylonia, but also those of the
south coast of Africa, and even of India. Artemidorus
told us that the Sab&aelig;ans crossed the Arabian Gulf on
boats of skins in order to bring back the products of
Ethiopia. Though it was possible to cross the narrow
basin by these means of transit, the mouths of the
Indus and the coasts of Malabar were beyond the
reach of such skiffs. If in the course of time Indian
wares reached Syria through the Sab&aelig;ans, they must
have been brought by the Indians themselves to the
coasts of the Sab&aelig;ans. At the beginning of the
second century <small>B.C.</small> the island Dioscoridis, off the
coast of Somali, which was known to the West
as the Land of Cinnamon, formed the centre of the
trade between Egypt, South Arabia, and India. To
this island the ships of the Indians brought the
products of their land.</p>

<p>In the first instance the Arabs transported the
goods from South Arabia to the Euphrates and the
Nile on their camels, and afterwards it lay with them
to permit or refuse a passage for the caravans of the
Babylonians and Phenicians. First one tribe and
then another lay in wait for the caravans, plundered
them, or allowed them to buy a passage, convoy, or
guide.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Eratosthenes has already told us that the
merchants took seventy days in going from the
Min&aelig;ans to Aela, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to Elath, on the north-east
point of the Arabian Gulf, and Pliny fixes the
distance from Gaza to Thamna, the chief city of the
Cattabani, at seventy-five days' journey. Of the
caravan road which led from the Sab&aelig;ans, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in all
probability from Maryab to Elath, we only know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
it ran along the coast, then passed from Elath by
Sela and Bosra into the mountains of the Edomites,
then divided the land of the Moabites and Ammonites,
passed by Kir Moab (Charak Moab) and Rabbat
Ammon, Edrei and Ashtaroth Karnaim, through the
land of the Jeturites, to Damascus, and finally, from
this place reached the cities of the Phenicians. A
second road led apparently past the Oasis of Duma
(Dum&aelig;tha of Ptolemy, Dumat-el-Dshandal) straight
to Damascus. In the east the Dedanites brought the
products of South Arabia through the desert, by the
land of the Temanites and Kedarites, to the Lower
Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The goods not required for Babylonia
then passed up the Euphrates to Harran (Charr&aelig;).
From this point the caravans turned to the west, and
in twenty days arrived through the desert at the
coasts of the Phenicians.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>How active the trade with the land of frankincense
was is shown by the words of the Hebrew prophet,
who proclaims to the new Jerusalem: "A multitude
of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian
and Ephah (see below); all they from Shebah shall
come; they shall bring gold and incense. All the
flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee;
the rams of Nebajoth shall minister unto thee."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The
Arabs, when conquered by the Persians, were compelled
to pay a yearly tribute of 1,000 talents of incense,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> at least 60,000 pounds. This they could only
obtain from South Arabia, and to Western nations
the connection between Damascus and South Arabia
appeared so close, that they represented the Sab&aelig;ans
as colonists of the Egyptians, Ninus and Semiramis
having sent colonies from Damascus to Arabia Felix.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the Phenicians could receive the products
of South Arabia and the Somali coast by the high
road of Elath, and from the Euphrates by Harran,
they were nevertheless eager to have a connection by
sea with these regions. They availed themselves of
the relations in which they stood to Solomon, king of
Israel, in order to send ships from Eziongeber down
the Arabian Gulf, to Ophir, as far as the mouth of
the Indus. These ships brought back sandalwood,
apes, peacocks, and gold. This trade fell with the
decline of the kingdom of Judah, after the time of
Jehoshaphat. But when Amaziah of Judah again
subjugated the Edomites, about the year 790 <small>B.C.</small>,
and after him his son Uzziah again advanced the
borders of Judah to the Red Sea, the Phenicians
also resumed their connection with the kings of
Judah and the trade to Ophir.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Afterwards Pharaoh
Necho gave them an opportunity for a short time to
set out upon their voyages in the Arabian Gulf, not,
indeed, from the north-east, but from the north-west
corner of the Red Sea. But immediately afterwards
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, by subduing the
Dedanites and planting Babylonian centres of trade
on the coast of Dedan and at the mouth of the
Euphrates, succeeded in transplanting the marine
trade with South Arabia to the Persian Gulf,
while the conquest of the Kedarites also put him in
a position to strike a road across the desert from
Babylon to Sela (in the land of the Edomites, see
below). Darius or the Ptolemies were the first to
succeed in the attempt made by Rameses II. and
Necho, and concentrated in the Bay of Heroonpolis
the trade of Egypt and Syria with South Arabia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;so we must
conclude&mdash;the tribes of South Arabia delivered their
spices to the Egyptians, Syrians, and Babylonians,
and their incense, which Eastern nations, and in time
Western nations also, burned upon the altars of their
gods. Then they imported the products of the opposite
shore of Africa, a region no less fruitful than
South Arabia, and at length the ships of the Indians
brought to them the products of the Indus and the
Ganges. Thus South Arabia not only exported her
own fruits, she became the central mart of East
African and Indian products, the point of connection
between Eastern and Western Asia. Owing to the
fertility of their valleys and terraces, and their old and
extensive trade, the tribes of the South soon acquired
a more fixed form of constitution and a more
advanced civilisation. Numerous remains of magnificent
stone structures, ruins of aqueducts, canals,
basins, and dams, built with the object of preserving
and collecting the water which streamed down the
terraces of the mountains and in the valleys, still
excite the astonishment of our travellers for the
excellence of the plan as well as for the strength
of the masonry. The ruins of Nedshran, Sirwah,
Ghorab, Nakb-el-Hadshar, and Misenat, and those of
Maryab, the old metropolis of the Sab&aelig;ans, confirm
what Western writers and Arab tradition tell us of
the glorious palaces of the ancient time and the mighty
dams built in the valley of Maryab.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The remains of
the dams prove that South Arabia, like Egypt and
Babylonia, was far better cultivated in those distant
times than now; that there also the greatest importance
was attached to irrigation, and the inhabitants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
understood how to preserve and use the water from
the mountain-streams on the terraces. The natural
assumption that at one time the cultivation of
valuable fruits was far more extensive in South
Arabia than at present can hardly be incorrect. The
inscriptions found in those ruins and elsewhere in the
south-west of Yemen, though they do not, so far as is
at present ascertained, go back beyond the year 120
<small>B.C.</small>,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> give us some insight into the nature of the
civilisation of these tribes and the ancient form of
the South Arabian language and alphabet, which must
have grown out of the Phenician at an early date,
and then have developed independently beside it.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Of
a still more recent date, from the first century <small>A.D.</small>,
we find in the opposite north-west corner of Arabia
numerous inscriptions on the rocks in the region of
Sinai, written in the North Arabian language and
alphabet.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>The Hebrew Scriptures divide the tribes of the
Arabs into four groups&mdash;the Joktanites, among whom
tribes of the south and east take the lead; the
Keturites, among whom are tribes of Western and
Eastern Arabia; the Ishmaelites, including tribes of
the table-land of the interior and North Arabia; and
finally, the group of tribes who settled and wandered
on the eastern borders of Canaan&mdash;the Amalekites,
Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites. The Hebrews derive
the origin of the Arabs from the progenitors from
whom they were themselves sprung. To Shem, the son
of Noha, so Genesis tells us, Arphaxad was born, and
"Arphaxad begat Salah, and Salah begat Eber, and
Eber begat Peleg and Joktan.  And Joktan begat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth (the Chatramites,
in Hadramaut, <a href="#Page_314">p. 314</a>), and Jerah, and Hadoram,
and Uzal (Sanaa), and Diklah, and Obal, and Abimael,
and Sheba (the Sab&aelig;ans), and Ophir and Havilah (the
Chaulot&aelig;ans), and Jobab (the Jobarites of Ptolemy,
on the south coast), and their dwelling was from
Mesha (Maishan, Mesene on the Euphrates) towards
Sephar (Dshafar, to the south of Sanaa and Maryab),
a mount of the East." Peleg, the elder brother
of Joktan, was the father of Reu, Reu, of Serug;
then followed Nahor and Terah. Terah's sons were
Abraham, Nahor, and Haran. To Abraham Hagar,
his Egyptian bond-servant, bore Ishmael. Abraham
sent Hagar and Ishmael into the deserts of Beersheba,
but "God was with the lad, and he grew and dwelt
in the wilderness of Paran, and was an archer, and his
mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt, and
his first-born was Nebajoth (the Nabat&aelig;ans, <a href="#Page_314">p. 314</a>),
and his sons were Kedar (the Kedarites) and Adbeel,
and Mibsam, and Mishma, and Dumah (<a href="#Page_320">p. 320</a>), and
Massa (the Masanians of Ptolemy), and Hadar, and
Thema (the Themanites, <a href="#Page_314">p. 314</a>), and Jetur (the
Jeturites, near Damascus, <a href="#Page_320">p. 320</a>), and Naphish, and
Kedemiah, twelve princes; and the descendants of
Ishmael dwelt from Shur, which is before Egypt,
and from Havilah (<a href="#Page_314">p. 314</a>) to Asshur." "And
again Abraham took a wife, whose name was Keturah,
and she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan,
and Midian (the Midianites) and Ishbak, and Shuah.
And Joksham begat Dedan, and the sons of Midian were
Ephah and Epher (<a href="#Page_320">p. 320</a>). And Abraham gave them
gifts and sent them away into the east country."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
Abraham's son was Isaac, Isaac's oldest son was Esau,
the father of the Edomites, and Esau's grandson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Amalek, was the progenitor of the Amalekites.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
Haran, the brother of Abraham, begat Lot, and Lot's
sons were Moab and Ammon (the Moabites and
Ammonites). From these genealogies it is clear that
the Hebrews looked on the Arabs almost without
exception as kinsmen of their own,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> and as kinsmen
of a more ancient branch, for the Hebrews were
descended from the second son of Isaac. The place
nearest to themselves they give to the Ishmaelites, who
were divided into twelve tribes, the descendants of the
twelve princes, the sons of Ishmael&mdash;and next in order
came the Edomites, Ammonites, and Moabites.</p>

<p>The native tradition of the Arabs is without historical
value. Their recollections hardly go back as
far as the beginning of the Christian era, and all that
their historians who began to write after Mohammed
knew of the older fortunes of their race is either
borrowed from the Hebrews or mere imagination. The
Amalekites, whom they found in the Hebrew Scriptures,
they took for their original stock, and represented them
as dwelling in Canaan and Damascus, as well as in
the land of Mecca and Oman, and even as ruling over
Egypt. These Amalekites&mdash;the Tasmites and Dshadi,
the A'adites and Dshorhomites&mdash;they consider as the
genuine Arabs; to whom God had taught Arabic
after the confusion of speech. But the Tasmites and
Dshadi are as little historic as Amalek in the
Arabian tradition; their names signify "the extinct"
and "the lost;" the A'adites are a purely fabulous
nation, and the Dshorhomites (near Mecca) are a tribe
of no great antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> The progenitor of the southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
tribes of Yemen is, in the Arabian tradition, Kachtan,
the son of Eber, and great-grandson of Noah. This
is the Joktan of Genesis. Kachtan's son, J'arab,
founded the monarchy of the Kachtanids, in South
Arabia; Abd-Shams-Sabah, the grandson of J'arab,
built the city of Mareb, the chief city of the Sab&aelig;ans,
according to the Greeks. This founder of the
monarchy of the Sab&aelig;ans left two sons, Himyar and
Kachlan. The first was the progenitor of the
Himyarites, who are mentioned even by Western
writers, but not till the first century <small>A.D.</small>, and then
on the south coast between Mareb and Hadramaut.
The name Himyarites includes the tribes of the
Chatramites, the Codaa, the Kinana, the Dshoheina,
&amp;c. Kachlan founded Dshafar (<a href="#Page_324">p. 324</a>), and was
the progenitor of the Kachlanids, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Hamdanids,
the Badshila, the Odthan, the Chozaa, and other
tribes. To the kingdom of Mareb, founded by Abd-Shams-Sabah,
the Arab tradition ascribes a long list
of princes. But even if we ascribe a period of more
than thirty years to every name in this series, the
date of Kachtan is not carried back beyond 700 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
Abd-Shams-Sabah is said to have built not only
Mareb, but also a great dam for the irrigation of the
country. The excellent dams, canals, and sluices at
Sanaa (the Uzal of the Hebrews, westward of Mareb)
are said to have been built by Asad.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The castles of
Sahlin and Bainun (at Sanaa) are said to have been
built by demons at the bidding of Solomon for Belkis,
queen of Shebah. Besides these the Arabs talk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
numerous castles and fortresses in the south. Towards
the year 100 <small>B.C.</small> Harith, a descendant of Himyar,
obtained the throne of the Sab&aelig;ans; and the place of
the Sab&aelig;ans is taken by the Himyarites, the Homerites
of Western nations, who henceforth are the ruling
nation in Yemen, a change for which Arab tradition
prepares the way by making Himyar the son and
successor of Abd-Shams-Sabah. Harith's successors
fixed their residence first at Dshafar (Dhu Raidan),
then at Mareb, and finally at Sanaa.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>The tribes of the high land of the interior, whom
the Arabs call Neshd, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the high people," and
certain tribes of Hidyaz, are derived by tradition
from Adnan, a grandson of Ishmael. When Ibrahim
(Abraham) had sent away Hagar and her son, and
Hagar was about to perish in the desert, the child
Ishmael struck the earth with his foot, and from it
sprang the fountain of Zamzam, close to Mecca.
Amalekites, in search of their lost camels, found
the spring, settled down beside it, and worshipped
Ishmael as the lord of the spring. Then came tribes
from the South, the Dshorhomites and Katura, to
the fountain; and Ishmael married the daughter
of the chief of the Dshorhomites and begot Nabit
(the Nebajoth) and Kaidar (the Kedarites). The
Amalekites and Katura were then driven away,
and the Dshorhomites remained alone in possession of
the fountain of Zamzam. Kaidar's son was Adnan.
From Adnan sprang the Benu Bekr, the Taghlib, the
Temim, the Takif, the Gatafan, &amp;c. If we ascend
the genealogies which Arab tradition gives to the
princes of the tribes sprung from Ishmael, in twenty
generations, ending with Adnan, the grandson of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Ishmael, we only arrive at the end of the second
century <small>B.C.</small>, even if we allow thirty years for each
generation.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>The few facts which we can make out about the
religious worship of the southern Arabs (they belong
almost exclusively to the period in which the
Himyarites obtained the supremacy in South Arabia)
exhibit a certain connection with the worship of the
Babylonians; but we cannot ascertain whether this
coincidence, like the close relationship of the South
Arabian and Babylonian languages (<a href="#Page_256">p. 256</a>), is due
to original unity or later intercourse. The Byzantines
tell us that the Himyarites worshipped the sun, the
moon, and certain demons of the land. The tradition
of the Arabs mentions Abd-Shams-Sabah as the
founder of the kingdom of the Sab&aelig;ans, and the
name Abd-Shams signifies the servant of the sun-god,
and hence in the eyes of the Arabs the worship of the
sun-god must have occupied a very prominent place
in the religion of the Sab&aelig;ans&mdash;a fact which is
confirmed by the inscriptions. They mention the
sun-god (Shams, Shamas), the moon-god Al-makak,
and the gods Aththor, Haubas, and Dhu Samavi.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
The Himyarites are said to have worshipped the sun
under the form of an eagle (Nasr), and the Hamdanids
(who dwelt to the north of Sanaa and Mareb) under
the form of a horse; a third tribe in Yemen are said
to have worshipped him in the form of a lion.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>The accounts which we have of the religion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
the tribes who in the second century of our era, in
consequence of the bursting of a great dam at Mareb,
according to Arab tradition, migrated to the North,
and by this migration destroyed or drove out or amalgamated
with the new-comers a considerable number
of the old tribes of this region, prove that the immigrants
worshipped certain stars as their protecting
deities. The Tadshi immigrants from the South, who
pastured their flocks on the oasis of Duma (<a href="#Page_320">p. 320</a>),
worshipped Canopus; the Lachmites, who were driven
towards Hira, on the lower Euphrates, worshipped the
fortunate star Jupiter; and the Chozaa, who settled
to the north of Mecca, worshipped Sirius.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the religious rites of the tribes
derived by the Arabs from Adnan, we learn that
the Benu Bekr, who forced their way from Neshd
towards the Euphrates, worshipped the god Audh,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the burning one; an ancient form of oath used
by this tribe runs as follows&mdash;"I swear by the blood
streams round Audh and the stones set up beside
Suair." The Kinana and the Benu Gatafan in
Hidyaz worshipped the goddess Uzza, a name which
is said to signify "the mighty one" in a sacred tree.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
The tribe of the Takif (near Taif, southward of Mecca)
worshipped the goddess Allat, in whose name we can,
without difficulty, recognise the Alilat of Herodotus:
Alilahat means "the goddess." Among the palms of
the valley of Nachlah rose the mighty tree of the
goddess, "presented with sacred offerings;" but the
Takif also prayed to this goddess under the form of
a white stone. A third goddess, of the name of
Manat, held sway in the district of Medinah; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
was worshipped in a black shapeless stone. The
Kuraish swore by Allat, Uzza, and Manat.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Among
other tribes of the desert the goddess Halasah, or
Venus, was worshipped. According to the Western
writers the Nabat&aelig;ans are said to have worshipped
the sun and the war-god Dusares.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> "His image is
a black, undressed, rectangular stone, four feet high
and two feet broad, on a pedestal of beaten gold. To
this stone they offer sacrifice and pour libations with
the blood of the victims; such are their libations;
the whole temple is filled with gold and votive
offerings." Modern scholars identify this god Dusares
with the Du'sharah of Arabian writers.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Herodotus
has already told us that on the conclusion of agreements
the stones between the two parties were smeared with
blood; and, as according to this evidence, the idols
also were sprinkled with the blood of the victims,
we can explain the oath of Benu Bekr by the bloodstreams
round Audh. The statement of Herodotus
that the Arabs worshipped Urotal and Alilat only,
and the statements of Strabo and Arrian that they
worshipped Zeus, and Dionysus, and the sky, must
apparently be limited to the migratory tribes of the
north.</p>

<p>Of the gods worshipped by the tribes bordering
on Syria we have more definite knowledge. The
Midianites and Amalekites who possessed the sandstone
plateau of Sinai, and the deserts of Shur in the
north, and Sin in the south, worshipped on the highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
peaks of that district which the Hebrews called Horeb
and Sinai (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Sinian), the god Baal, who was
also worshipped by the Syrians. At the foot of Sinai
there still remains the well-watered palm grove, with
its rich black earth, of which Agatharchides and
Diodorus told us above (<a href="#Page_309">p. 309</a>). It is the oasis
of Firan, and from the palms the mountain above
it is still called Serbal, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the palm forest of
Baal."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The Moabites invoked Baal on Mount Peor,
and in times of distress appeased his wrath by human
sacrifices. In the same way the Ammonites worshipped
their god Milkom; the female deity of the Moabites
was Astor, the Astarte of the Syrians, who was also
worshipped by the Kedarites.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> That the Baal of
Sinai was a god who gave fruits and water in the
desert is clear from the fact that Herodotus could
compare the god of the Arabs with Dionysus, and
Strabo and Arrian could ascribe the worship of
Dionysus to the Arabs.</p>

<p>From a general view of these scanty notices it
becomes clear that the basis of the religious conceptions
current among the Semitic tribes of Arabia was not
widely different from that of the Semitic tribes by
the Euphrates and Tigris, or in Syria, which will be
found to be connected with each other. It is easy to
understand that the rites of the tribes bordering on
Syria were nearer to the rites of the Syrians, and
it has been already remarked that the worship of
the southern tribes appears to be most closely allied
to the rites of the Babylonians. Here, as there, we
find the worship of Astarte; Herodotus expressly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
calls the goddess of the Arabs by the name of
Mylitta, the Bilit of the Babylonians, whom, as
we shall see, the Canaanites also worshipped with
much zeal. We saw that in Babylon her power
was recognized in the evening gleam of the planet
Venus, that all young things, fountains, and pools,
belonged to this goddess; and we shall find her
worshipped in Syria on the shady heights of Lebanon.
The tribes of the Arabian deserts also consecrated
lofty trees to this goddess, their Allat, or Halasah;
and just as they believed that the power of this, as of
other deities, was present in stones, so shall we find a
similar custom prevailing among the Syrians. That
the tribes of the deserts should pay especial reverence
to the deities of the stars&mdash;we have seen how
systematised was the worship of stars in Babylon&mdash;cannot
surprise us. With the refreshing dew of
evening not Venus only or the moon, but the whole
glory of the starry heaven met the eye and touched
the spirit of the Arabs. High above the tents and
resting flocks, above the nocturnal ride and waiting
ambuscade, and all the doings of men the stars passed
along on their glittering courses. They guided the
Arabs on their way through the deserts; certain
constellations announced the wished-for rain, others
the wild storms, the changes of the seasons, the time
for breeding in their herds and flocks. As these
stars at one time brought abundance and good
pastures for their flocks, and at another dried up the
springs and scorched the meadows, so could they
also bring joy and happiness or trouble and pain to
men. Hence to the tribes of the desert especially
brilliant stars appeared as living spirits, as rulers
over nature and the fortunes of mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>The life of the roving tribes in the interior whom
the Arabs denote by the general name of Badawi
(Bedouins), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "sons of the desert," has undergone
few changes; at the present day but slight deviations
have been made from the customs and conditions
of the ancient time. Their life was regulated
according to their descent in patriarchal forms, and
the basis of it was the natural affection of the family.
At the head of the tribe stood the chief of the oldest
family, from which the rest derived their origin. All
descendants of the patriarch who had given the name
to the tribe gave a willing obedience to his nearest
descendants, for the claims of primogeniture were
sacred. The wealth in horses of excellent breed, camels,
and cattle is the pride of these tribal chiefs and the
symbol of their supremacy. Surrounded by the council
of the elders, the heads of the other families, the
chiefs maintained peace in the tribe, settled quarrels,
led out the youth of the tribe on plundering
expeditions and in feuds, and divided the spoil.
They alone had the right to assemble the tribe, to
carry the standards under which the tribe fought, and
give the command in battle. In rare instances the
remembrance of a common origin keeps several tribes
together in a kind of union under the chief of the
oldest tribe, from which the others have branched off,
but as a rule the tribes hold proudly aloof and are
hostile to each other. They attack each other,
plunder the tents, carry off the women, children,
and servants, and drive away the flocks. When a
feud has once broken out and members of a tribe
have been slain, it is incumbent on the family and
tribe to which the dead belonged to revenge the
fallen, and kill at least as many members of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
hostile tribe. This duty of revenge is hereditary
on either side, and descends from generation to
generation until the chief of a third tribe is chosen
to decide the quarrel and become a peace-maker by
fixing a fine of cattle or other property.</p>

<p>In such a mode of life, which, in its general
features, has remained unchanged for thousands of
years, the Arabs of the desert exercised the virtues
of reverence, piety, and attachment to their tribal
chiefs; thus there grew up among them a steadfast,
manly character; they were true to their promise
when once given, and displayed a noble hospitality.
If any one came in peace to their tents, drink was
given to him by the daughters of the tribe from the
fountains, the men took him as a friend into their
tents and shared their store of dates with him, or
entertained him with a sheep from the flock. When
the stranger had once set his foot in the tent, the
host guaranteed his safety with his own life. When
the night came on with her refreshing coolness, the
stranger was required to sit in the starlight in the
circle of the tribesmen. He was expected to tell of
his origin, his race, and tribe; and then the hosts
also told the fame of their ancestors and sang the
deeds of their fathers and themselves, the feuds and
encounters in which their tribe had been victorious,
the virtues of their favourite horses, and the swiftness
of their camels.</p>

<p>Poetry was the only form of intellectual life known
to the tribes of the desert. The Bedouins had a lively
sense of the incidents which broke the simple loneliness
of their lives, and gave them a vigorous and
even a fiery expression. The artless song was the
expression of feelings deeply stirred by sorrow or joy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Such songs were equally adapted for calling to mind
their own deeds and fortunes or those of the tribe, and
for moral exhortation. They were "occasional" pieces.
Lament for the dead, praise of the noblest warrior,
the battles and exaltation of the tribe, the generosity
and courage of their own tribe or hatred of the hostile
tribe, derision of the enemy, hunting, weapons, rides
through the desert, horses and camels, are the subjects
of this poetry, which is expressed in short iambic
verses. Tradition mentions Lokman as the oldest
poet. He is supposed to be a contemporary of David;
and round his name is gathered a number of proverbs,
gnomes, and fables. The short poems lived on in
the tribe, they were sung again and again, extended
and recast. At a later time there were also rhapsodes
who could repeat a store of such poems.</p>

<p>The Arabs have developed in the most healthy and
marked manner the characteristic features of the
Semitic race. Their roving life in the deserts under
the burning sun and amid tempests and whirlwinds of
sand has strengthened and hardened them. Surrounded
in pathless isolation by beasts of prey and hostile
tribes, every one was dependent on his own watchfulness
and keenness, on his courage and resolution, on
his horse and his lance. On a frugal and scanty sustenance
the body became lean and thin, but supple,
muscular, and capable of endurance; and in these
hardy bodies dwelt a resolute spirit. Thus the Arabs
display a freer attitude, a more steadfast repose, a
more haughty pride, a greater love of independence,
and a more adventurous boldness than their kinsmen.
Their land and their mode of life have saved them from
the greedy avarice, from the luxury and debauchery,
into which the Semitic nations on the Euphrates and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Tigris, as on the Mediterranean, often fell, though
they share in the cruelty and bloodthirstiness common
to their race. It was the Arabs on whose virgin
strength a new Semitic empire and civilization was
able to be founded in the Middle Ages, when Babel
and Asshur, Tyre and Carthage, Jerusalem and
Palmyra had long passed away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE CANAANITES.</h3>


<p>Between the basin of the Euphrates and Tigris and
the Mediterranean rise the mountains of Syria, an
elevated plateau which ascends gradually from the
right bank of the Euphrates and descends steeply on
the sea-coast. A peculiar depression, known as Hollow
Syria,<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> divides this region in its entire length from
north to south&mdash;from the Taurus to the <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> point of
the Red Sea, and separates the plateau into an eastern
and a western half. The bed of the narrow valley
reaches its greatest elevation in the neighbourhood of
the city of Baalbec (Heliopolis). From this point
the Orontes flows towards the north and irrigates
the green gardens of Emesa and Hamath, till it turns
westward and finds a way toward the sea at Antioch;
the Leontes and the Jordan flow towards the south.
Between steep walls of rock the Jordan hurries down
the gorge, and passes in a rapid course through the
lakes of Merom and Kinneroth (Gennesareth), which
are formed by the streams from the mountains on
either side. The deeper the bed of the valley the more
valuable are the fruits growing in the tropic atmo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>sphere.
The country round Jericho, the city of palms,
sheltered from the winds of the table-land and heated
by the rays refracted from the walls of rock, produces
grapes and figs for ten months in the year; its wealth
in dates and balsam was rated high in antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
The course of the Jordan ends in the Dead Sea, the
surface of which is about 1,300 feet below the level
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Out of Hollow Syria rises on the east like a wall of
rock the plateau of Aram,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> in naked, wild, and broken
ridges, which, in Antilibanus, the highest point,
reaches 9,000 feet. On the back of the mountains
we find at first green pastures overshadowed by
forests of oak, but further towards the east the
heights become bald and desolate, until the land, as
it sinks towards the Euphrates, gradually assumes
the character of the deserts, which are broken only
by the fruitful depressions of Damascus, Hieropolis
(Membidsh), and Tadmor (Palmyra).</p>

<p>On the west of the fissure the land is differently
shaped. The coast is a narrow strip of land, which
only extends into small plains at the mouths of the
mountain streams; it is hot, moist, and unhealthy,
but of great fertility. Soon the white and yellow
limestone rocks of the mountains begin to rise. On
these heights the air is purer and cooler, and terraces
planted with myrtles and oleanders, with pines, fig-trees,
and mulberries, alternate with vineyards. On
the broad slopes of the loftier mountain ridges rise
splendid forests of tamarisks, planes, cypresses and
nut-trees, and above all magnificent cedars. Even
now some trees are found here forty feet in girth and
ninety feet in height.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Just in front of the highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
ridges of rock lie green slopes, on which feed numerous
flocks of black goats, disturbed by jackals, bears, and
lions, dwelling in the desolate gorges. Between the
mouth of the Orontes and the promontory of Carmel,
which runs out far into the sea, this mountain wall,
which stretches out to the sea, reaches its greatest
height in the peaks of Libanus (over 10,000 feet) of
which Tacitus remarks with astonishment that they
retained the snow even in that hot climate.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Rising
above the green pastures and forests, the cultivated
and watered fields, this ridge with its white mantle of
snow gives the appearance of a winter landscape above
perpetual spring. Southward of Carmel the mountains
become lower, and at the same time less precipitous
and picturesque. The coast is broader and more
sandy, flatter, and with fewer harbours. In the place
of the steep ridges is a grassy depression (Esdraelon,
Galilee), overtopped by one or two peaks only, like
Tabor (1,700 feet). Then parallel ridges again form
valleys, broad and fruitful and overshadowed by
forests (Samaria), until the land between the Dead
Sea and the coast assumes a severer and wilder
character. There the table-land is rough and bare,
the valleys are narrow and deep clefts, the soil is
stony. From Libanus the eye looks out on the most
various groups of wooded promontories and a smiling
coast, but in Jud&aelig;a the landscape exhibits none but
severe and simple outlines. On the wide expanses
only a few bushes of pale olives arise, or transparent
groups of a few palm-trees. The grassy plains have
made way for steppes or downs, and even the bed of
the valleys is covered with fresh green only in the
brief rainy season. The region round the Dead Sea
is wholly desolate. Springs of sulphur and beds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
of bitumen point to a volcanic origin; the large
proportion of salt contained in the water makes it
impossible for fish to live in the lake, and the deposits
of salt which cover the country round restrict the
vegetation.</p>

<p>In contrast to the vast and uniform regions of the
Tigris and Euphrates and Arabia, the western mountains
of Syria exhibit change and variety. The
narrowness of the coast forces the inhabitants upon
the sea, the luxuriant fertility of the deeper valleys
invites to cultivation of the land and the planting
of vines and orchards, while the upland valleys and
mountain slopes permit nothing but pastoral life,
combined with a little agriculture. There is no
central district from which these numerous and for
the most part secluded mountain cantons can be
brought into unity and governed. In the place of
the uniform development of large masses of people we
have here to expect a variety of modes of culture;
in the place of one huge despotic kingdom, and the
uniform movement of wandering tribes a more independent
and unfettered development of small communities;
sharp contrasts appear in the place of a
general civilisation. At the same time these Syrian
coasts by the sea and mountain air, by life on the
ocean and among the hills, compensate to a great
degree the enervating influences of the Eastern sun,
and thus the elements are combined which are wont to
keep fresh and vigorous the life and power of the
inhabitants. As the sea attracted the inhabitants to
distant regions, and trained upon its waves a mobile,
enterprising, active population, so on the other hand
did the severe formation of the hills and the seclusion
of the valleys lead to a uniform unchanging mode
of life and a desire to retain what was customary and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
traditional. The nearer these opposites approached
each other the more energetic must have been their
mutual operation, the more lively the process of
intellectual life, and the more productive its results.</p>

<p>The mountain district extending on the west of the
fissure from Mount Hermon and the sources of the
Orontes southward as far as the desert which divides
Syria from Egypt was by its inhabitants called Canaan.
We met with this name already in the inscriptions of
Sethos I. It means lower land, and has obviously been
transferred from the coast to the interior. Among the
Greeks the southern strip of coast was named Pal&aelig;stina,
after the Philistines (the Pelishtim) who possessed
it; the northern part, from Carmel to the Eleutherus
(Nahr-el-Kebir) was Phenicia; among the Egyptians
the coast was known as Kaft; the tribes of the
interior, and more especially those of Northern Syria,
were known as Retennu.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The oldest information about these districts which
has come down to us is contained in the statements
about the campaigns which Kudur-Lagamer and
Kudur-Mabuk of Elam are said to have undertaken
against Syria (<a href="#Page_251">p. 251</a>). If we might regard the kings
of Elam, who extended their power over Babylonia,
and then forced their way to Syria, as belonging to
the fourth dynasty of Berosus, the campaign of Kudur-Lagamer
and Kudur-Mabuk could be placed about
the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small> When Babylonia under Sarrukin
and Hammurabi shook off the supremacy of Elam,
Sarrukin is said to have advanced towards Syria as
far as the "Western Sea" (<a href="#Page_260">p. 260</a>). Three centuries
later Syria was attacked from the western or opposite
side. As soon as the kings of Upper Egypt had
succeeded in expelling the Hyksos from the land, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
carried their arms towards Syria, and in these campaigns
repeatedly touched the Euphrates. In the
times of Tuthmosis I. (1646-1625 <small>B.C.</small>) we are told
that he traversed Syria towards the north, advanced
as far as the Euphrates, and set up a column there.
Tuthmosis III. (1591-1565 <small>B.C.</small>) marched seven
times against Syria; in the fourth campaign (1580
<small>B.C.</small>) he reached and crossed the Euphrates; then he
appears to have advanced through Mesopotamia
as far as the Tigris, and to have collected tribute
there.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> More than one hundred and fifty years later
Sethos I. (1439-1388 <small>B.C.</small>) fought against the Schasu,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Shepherds, "who extend as far as Canana,"
the Cheta (Hittites), and the Retennu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
Syrians. Ramses II. (1388-1322 <small>B.C.</small>) invaded
the land of Kaft, and caused memorials of his
victories to be engraved upon the rocks at Nahr-el-Kelb,
in the neighbourhood of Berytus, fought
against the Hittites and their allies from the Euphrates,
the prince of Karchemish, and then concluded
peace and entered into friendship with the
prince of the Cheta (<a href="#Page_150">p. 150 ff</a>). The campaigns of
Ramses III. (1269-1244 <small>B.C.</small>) were also directed
against the Schasu, the Cheta, whose prince he took
alive, the Amari (the Amorites) and the Pulista (the
Philistines, <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>).</p>

<p>The inscriptions of these Pharaohs prove that the
tribes of Syria, even as early as the sixteenth century
<small>B.C.</small>, had arrived not only at a settled mode of life,
but at a vigorous trade and a civilisation far from
contemptible. The princes of Syria met Tuthmosis
III. with numerous war-chariots, of which in the
battle of Megiddo they lost 924 (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>). If
Tuthmosis can mention 107 cities from Hamath in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the north to Gaza in the south which he had
subjugated, the population must have been already
more numerous and the land more thickly inhabited.
The names quoted prove that Gaza (Kazatu), Damascus
(Tamesku), Hamath (Hamtu), Joppa (Japu), Berothai
(Berytus), Kades (Kadeshu), Ashtaroth Karnaim
(Astartu), and many cities frequently mentioned at
a later date, were already in existence: several of
them are represented to us on the monuments of the
Pharaohs, as situated on heights and surrounded by
strong walls.</p>

<p>The tribute received by Tuthmosis III. from Syria
is sufficient evidence that the valleys of Canaan were
well cultivated, that extensive trade relations had
already been formed, and that metals were in use
to a considerable amount. Syria contributed to
Tuthmosis not wine only, honey and dates, but also considerable
quantities of spices. The Retennu contributed
at one time 1,718 min&aelig; of sweet wine. The Hittites
contributed 8 silver rings, weighing in all 301 Egyptian
pounds, and 93 Egyptian pounds of gold; the
Retennu paid 40 bars, and afterwards 80 bars (bricks)
of iron; on one occasion they contributed 761 Egyptian
pounds, and in another year 1,495 pounds of
silver and 55 pounds of gold.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> It was remarked
above (<a href="#Page_304">p. 304</a>) that these tributes also prove that the
measures and weights of Babylon were already in
use in Syria at that time.</p>

<p>The monuments of the Pharaohs also prove that
the land was divided into independent districts,
governed by hereditary princes. The leading and
most powerful tribe at the time of the Ramessids was
that of the Hittites in the south of Canaan. In the
fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small> this tribe, with its confede<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>rates,
could place 2,500 war chariots in the field. We
have already seen (<a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a>) that the king of the
Hittites, the son of Maursar and grandson of Sepalulu,
entered into an alliance and compact with Rameses II.,
as one power with another. In the records of the
Egyptians the court and army of the Hittites are
found well arranged. Generals of the cavalry, masters
of the horse, and scribes are mentioned, and the
sculptures of the Pharaohs exhibit the Hittites in
their chariots in magnificent clothing and armour.
The inscriptions of Rameses II. mention Baal and
Astarte as gods of the Hittites&mdash;deities which we
have already found at Babylon under the names of
Bel and Istar. We have less information of the land
of Kaft, of the Amari, and finally of the Pulista, who
are first mentioned under Rameses III., and of the
tribes of the Retennu to the north of the Cheta. As
was remarked above, the Pharaohs did not succeed in
establishing a lasting supremacy over Syria. Even
Tuthmosis III., who achieved the greatest successes,
did no more than force the Syrian princes to pay him
tribute for a short series of years.</p>

<p>Thus the beginnings of settled life, of agriculture,
of cities and trade in Canaan cannot be placed later
than the year 2,000 <small>B.C.</small>, and this result is confirmed
by the tradition of the Hebrews. According to
Genesis, Ham, the second son of Noah, begat Canaan,
and Canaan begat Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, and
Amori, and Hivi, and Arvadi, and Hamathi, and
afterwards the families of the Canaanites were spread
abroad.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Hence, with the Hebrews, the Sidonians
passed for the oldest Canaanites. The name means
Fishcatcher, and a tribe limited to a narrow strip
of coast may soon have betaken themselves to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
sea. The primogeniture of the Sidonians was afterwards
explained to mean that the origin of their
city, Sidon, belonged to the oldest period. That the
second city of this tribe, Sor (Tyre), "the daughter of
Sidon,"<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> was proud of her great antiquity, we learn
from other sources. When Herodotus was there, and
inquired about the erection of the most sacred temple
in the city, the temple of Melkarth, he received the
answer that this shrine had been built, together with
the city, about 2,300 years before his time, i.e. about
the year 2,750 <small>B.C.</small> Lucian also assures us that the
temples of Phenicia and the temple of Melkarth at
Tyre were founded not much later than the oldest
Egyptian temples.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>Northward of Sidon, at the mouths of the Nahr
Ibrahim and the Nahr-el-Kelb (Adonis and Lycus),
was settled the tribe of the Giblites, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
mountaineers, whose cities were Gebal (Byblus)
and Berothai (Berytus). Byblus claimed to be
the oldest city in the land&mdash;older than Sidon&mdash;and
to have been built by El, the supreme deity.
At any rate, as we have already seen, it was in
existence at the time of Tuthmosis III., whose inscriptions
also mention the city of a third tribe, that of
Arvadi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Arvadites, whom the Hebrews mention
among the sons of Canaan. This tribe was in possession
of a considerable district to the north of Byblus, on the
mouth of the Nahr-el-Kebir (Eleutherus), and of a rocky
island off the coast, on which lay their city Arvad, the
Aratu of the Egyptians, the Aradus of the Greeks.</p>

<p>The tradition of the Hebrews derived the Hittites
from Heth, the second son of Canaan. The centre
of their land, which stretched from the coast to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Jordan, was formed by the bare and stony mountains
round Hebron. Here, according to Hebrew story,
giants once dwelt&mdash;the Anakim&mdash;whose father and
chief was Arba; after this prince, Hebron was formerly
called Kirjath-Arba. To this city also the
Hebrews ascribe a great antiquity; it was built seven
years earlier than Zoan (Tanis) in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> We do
not know the date of the building of Zoan, but the
name occurs as early as the inscriptions of Sesurtesen
I., whose reign we must place about the year
2,350 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> With the Hittites of Hebron the
Hebrew Scriptures represent their own forefathers
as living in peaceful and friendly intercourse in the
century 2100-2000 <i><small>B.C.</small></i> We have already seen
what a sustained resistance the disciplined forces of
the princes of the Hittites were able to make against
the attacks of Egypt for two centuries&mdash;from the
middle of the fifteenth to the middle of the thirteenth
century <small>B.C.</small> War against the Cheta is a standing
item in the inscriptions of the Ramessids.</p>

<p>Northward of the Hittites lay the tribes which
the tradition of the Hebrews derives from Hivi
and Amori, the younger sons of Canaan, the Hivites
and Amorites&mdash;the former in the beautiful mountain
valleys round Gibeon and Sichem, northwards as
far as Mount Hermon; the latter, a numerous and
powerful tribe, outside the land of Canaan, north-east
of Jordan, from the Jabbok in the south to
Hermon in the north.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> The Amorites, as we may
venture to assume, were the Amari of Egyptian
inscriptions. Furthest to the north, in the valley of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the Orontes, were the Hamathites, whom the Hebrews
also reckon among the sons of Canaan.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Damascenes, the northern
neighbours of the Amorites, whose city is mentioned
by the Egyptians with Hamath as early as the sixteenth
century, and who in the ninth and eighth
centuries <small>B.C.</small> were the centre of the most powerful
community in the Syrian interior, were not reckoned
by the Hebrews among the sons of Canaan; and the
inscriptions of the Assyrians also place the Damascenes
among the Arimi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Aramaeens. Nor are the
old inhabitants of the valley of the Jordan included
by Hebrew tradition among the Canaanites, which
is here associated with the principalities of Sodom
and Gomorrah, of Adamah, Zeboim, and Zoar, and
the names of the princes who once fought against
Kedor Laomer in the valley of Siddim. But Jehovah
caused fire and brimstone to rain upon Sodom and
Gomorrah owing to the sins of the inhabitants, and
destroyed these cities and the whole region. The
Philistines also, whom we find in possession of the
coast from Gaza in the south to Carmel in the north,
were not counted by the Hebrews among the sons of
Canaan. It has been remarked that the name occurs
for the first time in Egyptian inscriptions in the first
half of the thirteenth century <small>B.C.</small> The Hebrews tell
us that the Philistines marched from Caphtor and overcame
the Avites, who dwell "in villages as far as
Gaza." By Caphtor we should probably understand
the eastern sea coast of Egypt, the north-east of the
Delta, where a Semitic population may have established
itself firmly from the time of the Hyksos, and may have
been able to maintain themselves after their expulsion.
Yet there is nothing to contradict the assumption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
that, at the time of their expulsion by Amosis and the
Tuthmosis, a part of the Hyksos turned towards Syria,
and that the Philistines were sprung from these. We
may remember that Manetho terms the Hyksos Phenicians,
or kinsmen of the Phenicians, and tells us that
they retired in the direction of Syria, and Herodotus
represents the shepherd Philitis as pasturing his flocks
at Memphis.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> In the eleventh century <small>B.C.</small> we find
the Philistines under the dominion of the princes of
the cities of Gaza, Ascalon, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron.
The princes had their palaces; the cities were protected
by walls and towers, and possessed extensive
temples, in which were images of wood and iron, and
rich offerings. The five cities formed a federation,
their princes (Seranim) sat in a common council, led
out their armies in common, and in common offered
thankofferings for the victories won. They could
bring into the field a splendid army of chariots,
horsemen, heavy-armed soldiers, and bowmen; the
soldiers were divided into troops of hundreds and
thousands.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the thirteenth century a
considerable alteration took place in the interior of
Canaan, between the coast of the Philistines and the
valley of the Jordan. The Amorites advanced towards
the south over the Jabbok, and subjugated the
Moabites, who dwelt in this district to the east of
the Dead Sea, as far as the Arnon. They spread
westwards over the Jordan, and overthrew the ancient
federation of the Hittites. These were either sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>jugated
or driven out; only in some mountain cantons
did the Hittites maintain themselves. In their place
the Amorites ruled between the coast and the Dead
Sea, and this district was now known as the "Mountain
of the Amorites."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Northwards also the Amorites pressed forward
against the Hittites, and took possession of their
land as far as Lake Merom.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> It was only in Gibeon
and the surrounding districts that the Hivites held
their own;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> and all the Hittites and Hivites who
refused subjugation and slavery were compelled to
retire to the coast. It must have been a heavy blow
that could shatter the power of the Hittites; while
the collection of a numerous population on the coast,
which was caused by the new supremacy of the
Amorites, was in its turn of important consequence
for the cities of Phenicia. But the new masters of
the southern land did not form a consolidated power,
like the Hittites before them; they were broken up
into separate tribes, so that among them, and the
remnants of the Hittites and Hivites, there were
about thirty small principalities. The ancient power
of the Hittites must have been important enough to
leave behind a very lasting impression. The Book of
Joshua uses the expression "land of the Hittites," for
the whole region from the sea to the Euphrates, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
the Assyrian inscriptions of the ninth, eighth, and
seventh centuries include beside the land of Arimi,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the Aram&aelig;ans the whole of Canaan from
Hamath to the sea and southwards as far as Egypt,
under the name of the "land of Chatti."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE RELIGIOUS RITES OF THE CANAANITES.</h3>


<p>Our knowledge of the religious conceptions of the
Canaanites consists of scattered and meagre statements.
Yet these statements are enough to show
with certainty that the ideas of the Syrians about the
powers of Heaven rested on the same basis as the
worship of the Babylonians. But the sensual and
lascivious side of this worship, no less than the cruel
and bloody side, is more strongly and broadly developed
in Syria than in Babylonia, while, on the other
hand, the complete development of the star-worship,
as we found it on the lower Euphrates, is unknown in
Syria. The gods who were regarded as alien and
hostile to natural life were worshipped by the Canaanites
with severe abstinence and harsh asceticism,
with self-mutilation and human sacrifices; while the
deities of procreation and birth, who were considered
favourable to life, were worshipped with the most
shameless prostitution and the most unbridled debauchery.
Indeed these rites, distinguished by sensual
excess and bloody asceticism, were united by that
mysterious link which in the human breast brings
debauchery and pain into close connection; and hence
this worship is a true copy of the Semitic mode of feeling,
which wavers between luxurious enjoyment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
fanatical destruction, between cringing servility and
stiff-necked obstinacy, between effeminate retirement
in the harem, and bold achievements in the battle-field.</p>

<p>The Phenicians are said to have possessed sacred
scriptures of very great antiquity. In Babylonia we
found a city to which the sacred scriptures were
specially allotted, Sepharvaim on the Euphrates; in
Canaan, Debir, in the neighbourhood of Hebron, was
at one time called Kiriath Sepher, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "city of
scriptures." The scriptures of the Phenicians are
said to be derived from Esmun one of their gods, or
from a series of hierophants, Thabion, Isiris, Sanchuniathon
and Mochus. According to the evidence of
Poseidonius, Mochus lived before the Trojan war.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
Sanchuniathon also, a Sidonian according to some,
according to others a Syrian, and to others a Berytean,
is said to have lived before or during the time of the
Trojan war. He is said to have collected his writings
from the archives of the Phenician cities, from the
records in the temples, and a document of Hierombal
which had been placed by the latter before Abelbaal,
king of Berytus, and had met with approval, and it is
maintained from the catalogue of the Phenician kings
that Hierombal and Sanchuniathon lived before the
Trojan war.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Of the writings of Sanchuniathon, Philo
of Byblus, who wrote in the first half of the second
century, <small>B.C.</small>, is said to have given a Greek translation
in his <i>History of the Phenicians</i>. Of this supposed
translation of a supposed original, discovered after much
research by Philo, besides which he pretended to have
made use of the sacred scriptures of the Egyptians, the
Books of Thoth, some excerpts and fragments have come
down to us. Scanty and unconnected as these are, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
show us at once that Philo, whatever his original may
have been, was far removed from any mere repetition
of old religious views, that the syncretistic culture of
his time had exercised a strong influence on his own
ideas, and that his whole point of view belongs to that
kind of enlightenment which pretended to find in the
gods a number of deified kings, who had once ruled
over the land in ancient days. Yet Philo also allowed
that, over and above these, the sun, moon, planets,
and certain elements were worshipped as gods.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>Following the cosmogonic systems, as they may
have been drawn out with greater definiteness after the
Hellenistic period, Philo assumes as the beginning of
all things an obscure and moving atmosphere, and a
dark and melancholy chaos. When the wind of his
Beginning felt the yearning of love, a mixture took
place, and this combination was named Desire. Desire
is the beginning of all things. From the union of the
wind with itself arose Mot, which some explain as
mud, others as putrefaction of a watery mixture. Out
of this arose the seeds of all and the origin of all
things. Mot was fashioned after the form of an egg.
"And then shone forth the sun and moon, and the
great constellations. As the air now sent forth a fiery
glow, winds and clouds arose from the kindling of the
sea and the earth, and vast tempests of rain streamed
down; and when all this dashed together, there
followed thunderings and lightning, by which the
creatures were awaked, and on the earth and in the
sea the male and the female elements began to move.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
And from the wind Kolpia and his wife Baau, which
means night, Aeon and Protogonus, mortal men, were
begotten. Aeon discovered the nourishment obtained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
from trees. And Aeon and Protogonus begot Genos
and Genea, who dwelt in Ph&#339;nicia; and when the
fierce heat came they stretched out their hands to the
sky and the sun. As they regarded the sun as the
only lord of the sky, they called him Belsamen, which
among the Phenicians means lord of the sky, and
among the Greeks Zeus." But Aeon and Protogonus
had also begotten children, called by the names
of Phos (light), Pyr (fire), and Phlox (flame). These
discovered fire by rubbing two pieces of wood
together, and taught the use of fire, and begot children
who surpassed all others in size and stature. The
names of these giants were given to the mountains of
which they possessed themselves, to Casius, Libanus,
Anti-libanus, and Brathy (Tabor?). The giants begot
Samemrumus, who is also called Hypsuranius, and
Usous. These made a traffic of their mothers, for it
was the custom in those days for the women to
associate with any one. Samemrumus lived at Tyre,
and discovered the art of making huts out of reeds
and sedge, while Usous invented clothing made of the
skins of the beasts which he knew how to slay.
Samemrumus rebelled against Usous, but the latter
took a tree and divested it of the branches, and was
the first who went on board a vessel. Then he dedicated
two pillars to the fire and the wind, and offered
to these the blood of the beasts which he had taken.
When the brothers were dead, prayers were offered to
the pillars, and each year a festival was celebrated in
honour of them. And for a long time afterwards
Agreus (the hunter) was among the descendants of
Usous, and Halieus (the fisher) among those of
Samemrumus. From these sprung two brothers, of
whom the one was Chusor, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Hephaestus, who discovered
the working of iron, and the other, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
invented the fish-hook and was the first navigator,
was named Zeus Meilichius;<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> and the two together
discovered the building of walls by bricks. From
these came Agros (the field), and Agrotes (the husbandman),
who was worshipped in Ph&#339;nicia as a god,
and was called the greatest god in Byblus. From
these sprung Misor and Sydyk; from Sydyk came the
Cabiri, who invented the ship.</p>

<p>About this time Eljon, named "the Highest," was
born, and a woman of the name of Beruth; and these
two dwelt at Byblus. They begot Uranus and Ge,
and when "the Highest" fell in conflict with wild
beasts, he was worshipped by his children as a god
with libation and sacrifices. But Uranus succeeded
his father in the kingdom, and took his sister Ge to
wife, and with her begot El, who is also called
Cronus, Dagon, who, after discovering corn and the
plough, was called Zeus Arotrius, and Atlas. But as
Uranus begot children with other women, El, when
he was grown up, determined to revenge the slight
put upon his mother. He provided himself with a
sickle and a lance of iron, attacked Uranus, drove him
from his throne, expelled him from the land, and took
the kingdom for himself. He surrounded his house
with a wall, and built Byblus, the first city of the
Phenicians. His brother Atlas, whom he suspected,
he threw into the abyss, and covered him with earth;
his son he slew with the sword, and cut off his
daughter's head. When in the thirty-second year of
his reign he had laid an ambush for his father Uranus
in the interior of the land, and in this way had got
him into his power, he cut off his genitals, close by
some springs and rivers. The blood flowed into these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
springs and streams, and this place became sacred, and
is shown even at the present day. At the wish of
El, "Astarte the Great," the daughter of Uranus, and
Zeus Demarus, the son of Uranus by a concubine, and
Adodus "the king of the gods," ruled over the land.
As a symbol of her supremacy, Astarte placed the
head of an ox on her own head, and when she had
wandered over the whole earth she found a star fallen
from heaven, took it, and dedicated it at Tyre on the
sacred island. But when a pestilence came, and a
mortality, El burnt his only son in royal robes as a
sacrifice to Uranus on the altar which he had erected,
and circumcised himself and forced his comrades to do
the same. The city of Byblus he handed over to the
goddess Baaltis, Berytus to the sea-god, to the Cabiri,
and to the descendants of Agrotes (the husbandman)
and of Halieus (the fisher), and when El came into the
land of the South, he gave all Egypt over to Taauthus
to be a royal habitation for him. To El, after his
death, was consecrated the star named after him.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>We should indeed be in an evil case if we were
restricted for our knowledge of Canaanitish rites to
these fragments, which carry so plainly on the front
of them their late origin, their fictitious genealogical
combinations, into which the gods are brought, their
over-subtle Euhemerism, and their mixture with Greek
and Egyptian ideas. That threads of various systems
of cosmogony intertwine and cross each other in
these fragments is proved by the derivation of the
origin of the world, first from the wind, and next
from chaos, and then from Kolpia and Baau, and by
the repetition even to the third time of the discovery
of hunting, agriculture, and navigation. Happily there
are other sources of information which allow us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
bring the statements of Philo into some sort of order,
and to supplement them in very essential points. We
saw that the highest god of the Babylonians was El.
If Philo tells us that the star known by his name, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the planet Saturn, was consecrated to king El after
his death, and if this king allows Astarte, Demarus,
and even Adodus, the king of the gods, to rule after
his death,&mdash;if he apportions cities and provinces to
Baaltis and the Cabiri,&mdash;it becomes clear enough that
for the Canaanites also El was the ruling god, and
that in Syria also the planet Saturn belonged to him.
But from the contest of El with Uranus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> with the
sky-god, in Philo, we may also with certainty conclude,
that among the Canaanites also the highest place was
allotted to Baal-Samim, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the lord of the sky, as
Philo rightly explains that name; Philo denotes him
as the god worshipped by the earliest generations of
mankind. Among the Greeks also there was a myth,
borrowed no doubt from the East, that Zeus (Baal) had
once striven with El-Cronus.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> As the god of Saturn,
the El of the Canaanites would have to be placed
beside the Adar of the Eastern Semitic nations.
The inscriptions of Ramses II. have already mentioned
Baal as the god of the Cheta. We also saw that the
nomads of the peninsula of Sinai consecrated their
highest mountain summit to the god of this name.
The Moabites invoked Baal on Mount Peor. In
Canaan also the mountain summits were sacred to
this deity; in the south of the land the lonely peak
of Casius on the Serbonian lake, then Carmel, Tabor,
and Hermon. The Philistines worshipped him at
Ekron; the names of numerous places in Canaan,&mdash;Baal
Hamon, Baal Hazor, Baal Meon, Baal Gad, Baal
Perazim, Baal Tamar, Baalath, Baalbec, &amp;c.,&mdash;give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
us sufficient proof of the widespread worship of Baal
in Canaan. We shall not go wrong if we regard him
as the deity of the beneficent operation of the sun.
If El cuts off the genitals of Uranus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Baal-Samim,
and the blood flows into the springs and
streams, the meaning of the myth is without doubt
that the beneficent god has imparted his life-giving,
creating power to the fertilising water. Among the
Phenicians springs and streams were sacred. The
Carthaginian Hannibal swore to his compact with
Philip king of Macedonia before "the rivers, meadows,
and waters," and the Zeus Demarus of Philo must be
explained as Baal Tamar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Baal in the procreative
power. Northward of Sidon there falls into the sea a
river especially sacred to Baal Tamar, which the
Greeks called Tamyras (now Nahr Damur). It marks,
no doubt, the spot where the act in the myth was
localised, which, as Philo observes, was still pointed
out. Pliny tells us that with the Belus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Baal
(Sihor Libnath of the Hebrews), a mountain stream
falling into the sea southward of Sidon, after a brief,
and in the plain, a sluggish course from the parent
lake, customs of a very sacred nature were connected.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>The goddess whom the Syrians invoked, beside
the sun-god, had various names. According to
the fragments of Philo, El had handed over the
government of the city of Byblus to Baaltis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to
Bilit, the "mistress." At Ascalon she was known as
Derceto, at Hierapolis (Bambyke, Membidsh) as
Atargatis;<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> the Hebrews call her Ashera. Herodotus
calls the goddess of Ascalon Aphrodite Urania;
he also denotes her as the goddess of the sexual im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>pulse
and of procreation, and mentions the temple at
Ascalon, as the oldest temple of this goddess which
he knew; "from this comes the shrine of Urania in
Cyprus, as the Cyprians themselves said; and the
Phenicians, who also belonged to Syria, founded the
temple of Urania on Cythera." Pausanias observes
that the Assyrians had been the first among men to
worship Urania, and after the Assyrians came the
Paphians in Cyprus, and the Phenicians at Ascalon.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
Hence we may conclude that Baaltis, in nature or in
name, was not far removed from the Bilit or Mylitta
of the Babylonians, and this conclusion is sufficiently
confirmed by all that we know of the worship of
Baaltis. Cinyras, the first king of Byblus, is said
to have erected shrines to Aphrodite at Byblus and in
Cyprus, and his daughters are said to have paid
service to the goddess with their persons. The
maidens of Byblus waited for strangers in the market-places,
just as the maidens of Babylon waited in the
temple (<a href="#Page_269">p. 269</a>), and the price of compliance was paid,
as in Babylon, to Aphrodite.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Of the maidens of
Cyprus we are told that they went down to the sea
shore in order to sell themselves to the sailors on
landing.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> We also find that sacred servants, male
and female, who dedicated themselves to this form of
worship, were always to be found in the temples of the
Syrian goddess, and even married women entered
their ranks at certain times.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> The Hebrews tell us
that the women wove tents for Ashera, and that paramours,
male and female, were in her sanctuaries.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
shady groves, on green hills, and among the mountain
forests of Libanus, sacrifice was offered to this goddess.
The lofty trees, the terebinth, the evergreen
pine and the cypress were sacred to her; the pomegranate,
the symbol of fruitfulness, was her peculiar
fruit. The ram, the he-goat, and the dove, especially
the white dove, animals of vigorous procreation and
reproduction, were dedicated to her, and formed the
most welcome offerings. In the temples of the
goddess before the cell in which she was worshipped
under the form of conical stones or upright pillars of
wood, were dove-cotes and pools of water.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Fish
also were dedicated to this goddess; and certain kinds
of fish were sacred among the Syrians. These were
not to be injured, and enjoyed divine honours.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
Beside the rich and ancient temple of Derceto at
Ascalon was a lake abounding in fish. At Hierapolis
the image of Atargatis, which had a dove on the head,
was carried down to the lake near the temple. This
image of "the Assyrian Urania" was also carried
down to the sea, amid a great crowd collected from
Syria, Arabia, and Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The image of
Derceto at Ascalon, on the shore of the sea, in that
temple which was the oldest of Urania, known to
Herodotus, was a woman as far as the waist, but
from the thighs downwards she had the body of a
fish.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> From the custom of carrying the image of the
goddess to pools of water, and the form of the goddess
at Ascalon, has arisen the legend of the Greeks,
that at Ascalon or Hierapolis she threw herself into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
the water, and was changed into a fish. The colonies
of the Phenicians worshipped a Venus Marina, and
the goddess of Berytus is said to have come from the
sea; with the Greeks the goddess of Cyprus and
Cythera is said to have risen from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Appian
remarks that the goddess of Hierapolis was regarded
by some as Aphrodite, by others as Hera, and by
others again as the source and spring of all that
came out of moisture.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Hence the Bilit (Baaltis)
of Byblus, the Derceto of Ascalon, the Atargatis of
Hierapolis, the Ashera of the Hebrews, was a deity
favourable to birth and fertility, the power of nature
which creates from moisture and water.</p>

<p>A male deity also, who gave fruit and increase
from water, was worshipped by the Canaanites. At
Gaza and Ashdod, the cities of the Philistines, and
near the coast, at Beth-Dagon, and Kaphar-Dagon, the
god Dagon was invoked, whom Philo mentioned as
the Zeus Arotrius, the Zeus of the field, the god of
nourishment. His temple at Gaza was the pre-eminent
shrine of the Philistines, the centre of their
federation. The image of Dagon in his temple at
Ashdod had the face and hands of a man, the body
of a fish, and again the feet of a man.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Philo's
account denotes Dagon as the discoverer of the plough
and the god of nourishment, as the giver of corn and
protector of the field, and therefore he must in any
case have been a spirit of increase and fertility.
We found the name of this god in Babylonian inscriptions
of the time of Hammurabi, and before it,
his image, and that of his priests, among the monuments
of Assyria. We saw that his name designated
him as a fish-god, and know that Babylonian legends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
connected him with the sea, and represented him as
arising from the sea (<a href="#Page_272">p. 272</a>).</p>

<p>By the side of the deities of the beneficent powers
of nature and of birth, the Canaanites placed severe
and gloomy deities, who were averse and hostile to
the bloom of nature, the life and generation of mankind.
These were Moloch and Astarte. The first
is known to the Greeks under the name of Cronus,
and from Philo's account of El we must deduce the
relation of this god to Saturn. The Moloch of the
Canaanites is the cruel destroying god of war; fire in
its consuming, though also in its purifying properties,
was his element. He is said to have been represented
in the form of a bull or with a bull's head or
horns.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Among the booty which Sethos I. (1439-1388
<small>B.C.</small>) brought back from his campaigns against the
Cheta and Retennu we may see, in the sculptures at
Karnak (<a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>), the image of a bull.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The Canaanites
offered human sacrifices to Moloch. If we remember
that the Sepharvites of Babylonia offered up men
to Adrammelech, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "to king Adar," the spirit of the
planet Saturn, we may venture to regard the Moloch
of the Canaanites as the god of Saturn, without excluding
the possibility that the burning glow of the
midsummer sun may have lain at the root of the
Canaanite conception of this god.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Not only were
captives, often to the number of thousands, sacrificed
to Moloch in gratitude for the victory bestowed;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> but
also at the beginning of an important undertaking, or
the opening of a campaign, his favour was sought by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
human sacrifices. These were indispensable in order
to appease his wrath, and turn destruction from all
upon the head of a few.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> If the crops withered, or a
pestilence devastated the cities, or great reverses fell
upon the land in war, human victims were burned as
expiatory offerings.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Such offerings could only be
taken from among the native families. Pure victims
as yet undefiled by sexual intercourse, children and
youths, were, as it seems, the most welcome sacrifice.
The dearest possession was the most powerful expiation.
The best beloved children, the firstborn or
only son, must be offered to the god "as a ransom."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
We have seen above (<a href="#Page_356">p. 356</a>), how Philo represents
El himself as performing this sacrifice of a son. Only
the surrender of what was dearest could touch the
cruel feeling of the relentless god, and turn his wrath
upon the enemy so that he laid his curse upon him.
Thus it came to pass that the eldest son of the king
was clothed with purple and burned to Moloch in the
place of the ruler of the land. When Joram, king of
Israel, had shut up the king of Moab in Kir Harosheth,
"the Moabite took his firstborn son, who would have
been king in his place, and sacrificed him as a burnt
offering upon the wall. Then there was great indignation
against Israel, and Israel turned back to his own
land."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Hamilcar, Hanno's son, burnt himself in the

the Carthaginians; and when Himilco, in the year
406 <small>B.C.</small>, besieged Agrigentum, and a pestilence came
upon the army, he sacrificed a boy to Cronus, in order
to stay the plague.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> When Agathocles of Syracuse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
after landing in Africa had defeated the Carthaginian
army, and encamped under the walls of Carthage, the
Carthaginians believed that they had brought the
anger of the god upon them because of late, instead
of sacrificing the children of the noblest citizens, they
had secretly purchased and substituted other children.
Inquiry showed that this had been done in some
cases. In expiation, 200 boys of the first families
were selected as victims, and the families, who were
suspected of previously withdrawing their children
from the god, now spontaneously brought forward
300 children. "In Carthage," so Diodorus, who
tells us this incident, continues, "there was an iron
image of Cronus, which held out the hands in a
downward position, so that the victim placed upon
them rolled into a cavity filled with fire."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> The
cries of the victims, Plutarch tells us, were drowned
by the noise of drums and flutes; the mothers were
compelled to stand by without lamentation or sighing.
If a sigh or a tear escaped them, they were regarded
as dishonoured; but the child was burnt just the
same. A Roman poet gives an invocation to the
"paternal gods" of Carthage, whose temples are
cleansed by murder, and who rejoice in being
worshipped by the agony of mothers.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>The inscriptions of Ramses II. mentioned Astarte
as the goddess of the Hittites; the name of their
city Astaroth we have already found in the form
of Astartu in the inscriptions of Tuthmosis III.
(<a href="#Page_343">p. 343</a>). The Philistines worshipped Astarte; for
the Sidonians, the "great Astarte" was the goddess
of their city. "A virgin-goddess"<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> she ruled over
the fortune of battle; she is the goddess of war,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
bringing death and destruction, the goddess of death.
Coins of Sidon represent her with a spear in her
hand. As the goddess of war she carried a spear
in her temples in Cyprus and Cythera.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> In her
temple on the ancient fortress of Carthage, she was
represented riding on a lion, with a spear in her
hand. The Istar of the Babylonians and Assyrians
carried the bow (<a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>). When the Philistines
carried off the armour of Saul, king of Israel, they
dedicated it in the house of Astarte. If Astarte,
according to Philo, consecrates a star on the island
of Tyre, we have already seen (<a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>) that Venus
when rising was the star of Istar at Babylon. Yet
the Astarte of the Syrians stood in a closer relation
to the moon. Philo told us that she carried on her
head the head of an ox. The monuments of Sethos
display, beside the bull's image of Baal, a cow's head
with a segment of the moon; and on Carthaginian
stones we find the full moon between the horns of
an ox. With the horns of the moon the goddess
is known as Astaroth Karnaim, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the horned
Astarte. The priests of Astarte were pledged to
continence and celibacy, and on the priestesses of
the "heavenly maiden," the "maiden of the sky,"<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
virginity was imposed. No married woman could
enter her temples. In her temples, as in those of
Moloch, burned the eternal fire.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Like Moloch, Astarte
also received human sacrifices. To the virgin-goddess
the youthful were offered, and maidens and
women were burned.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> As in the worship of Ashera
the Syrians attempted to transfuse themselves into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
the nature of the goddess, to sink and pass into her
being, so also the worship of Astarte required that
they should become like the goddess, and that lust
should be killed in them. It was the highest and
most acceptable sacrifice, if priests and laymen made
themselves eunuchs in honour of the virgin-goddess.
During the festival of Astarte it was the custom,
while the congregated people were thrown into
excitement and frenzy by the sound of cymbals,
drums, and double pipes, for young men to spring
forward, seize the ancient sword which lay on the
altar of the goddess, and therewith to mutilate
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> At a later time there were thousands
of eunuch-attendants in the temples of Astarte, while
others went about through the land in female clothing,
their faces painted after the manner of women, begging
and mortifying their flesh. To the sound of drums
and pipes they whirled round with wild movements
and contortions of the body, and bent their heads
to the ground, so that their hair trailed in the mire.
At the same time they bit their arms and cut themselves
with swords. The most frenzied began to
moan and prophesy. At last he bewailed his sins,
took up the knotted whip, and beat himself on the
back till the blood ran down. When the dancing
and the scourging was ended, the eunuchs collected
subscriptions from the bystanders. Some gave money;
others, milk, wine, cheese, and meal. These they
hastily gathered together in order to compensate,
by a hearty meal at evening in their retreat, for
the torments of the day.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>These friendly and hostile, creative and destructive,
natural and supernatural powers stood mutually op<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>posed
in the religious consciousness of the Syrians.
Just as the Egyptians went forward, and saw in the
myth of Osiris the beneficent deity as the conqueror
of the evil god in the process of vegetative life and
in the revolution of the year, so did the Semitic
nations unite the beneficent and destructive powers
of heaven in the same deities, who in turn dispensed
blessing and destruction, and by themselves and in
themselves overcame the destructive element. This
combination is obvious in the form of Baal of Tyre,
whom the Tyrians invoked as the king and protector
of their city under the name of Melkarth,<i> i.e.</i> city-king.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
The Greeks identified this god with their own
Heracles; but as the protector of navigation and the
god of the sea, they are acquainted with Melkarth,
under his native name of Melicertes. Herodotus
was astonished at the splendour of the ancient
temple of this god at Tyre, at the richness and beauty
of the votive offerings, and the two rectangular pillars
in the temple, the one of pure gold, the other of
emerald, and so large that it shone by night.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Hiram,
king of Tyre, had dedicated the first about the year
1,000 <small>B.C.</small> to Melkarth. To the Phenicians Baal
Melkarth was a labouring and conquering deity, who
creates new life out of destruction, vanquishes the
baneful signs in the zodiac, brings back the sun
from perigee and apogee, from excessive heat and
wintry cold, to beneficial operation, whose life is
seen in the sun's course.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> When the sun burned
with the fiercest glow, and stood in the sign of
the lion, then the good sun-god must vanquish the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
lion or symbol of fiery heat; he pressed the lion
to his own breast, forced back into himself the fiery
beams, and consumed himself in his own heat. The
good sun-god must overcome the evil sun-god, or
he must consume himself, so that with renewed youth
he may again secure gentler warmth for the earth.
When the sun appeared most remote from the earth,
Baal of Tyre had gone on a journey or was asleep.
In the Phenician colonies in the West, in Crete, Sicily,
and at Gades, in the distant land of the setting sun,
were pointed out the resting-places of the deity, from
which he arose with the vernal sun to new activity
and life. At the end of February or the beginning
of March the festival of the awakening of the god
took place;<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> and if the Greeks tell us that Iolaus
awoke the god, Iolaus is merely a Grecised form of
Jubal, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the beauty of Baal, and therefore only a
mythical expression for the god himself as re-awakening
with the beautiful vernal sun.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> From these ideas
of strife and conquest Melkarth could become in the
eyes of the Phenicians a warrior-hero, who was thought
to have wandered over the earth, as the sun revolves
round it, in order to set it free from hostile powers.
With this conception may be connected the story that
the procreative power was taken from Uranus and
transferred to the springs and rivers, and that El's
brother Atlas, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Atel, a name which perhaps may
be explained as meaning darkness, is overthrown
and cast into the abyss. In the legends of the
Phenicians it was Melkarth who reduced the barbarous
tribes of the distant coasts, who founded the
ancient colonies of the Phenicians on the western
coasts of the Mediterranean, and set up, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
boundary stone of his wanderings, the two great
pillars at the end of the earth, the rocks of Calpe
and Abyle on the Straits of Gibraltar. As the restrainer
of the burning heat, of the lion, and of giants,
Melkarth is the Heracles of the Greeks; as a wandering
god who gives order to the life of mankind,
he bears, in Greece, the names Minos and Cadmus
(the name Kadmon means, "the man of the East"),
by which forms they expressed not the deity only,
but the old supremacy of the Phenicians, and their
settlements on their islands and coasts. The Hebrews
tell us that once, when a great drought attacked
the land, the priests of Baal assembled at Carmel and
invoked the god to consume with his rays the bull
which they placed as a sacrifice on the billets of
the altar. But the god heard them not. Then
Elijah, the prophet of the Jews, mocked them.
"Call louder," he said: "perhaps he is meditating
or hath a pursuit; he is on a journey, or perhaps
he is asleep and will wake up again." The priests
called louder, and became frantic, and cut themselves
with knives and lancets, so that the blood gushed out.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>As Baal and Moloch, the beneficent and the baneful
powers, were united in Baal of Tyre, and in the form
of Melkarth, so also was the goddess of reproduction,
of birth, and procreation amalgamated with the
warrior goddess, the maiden who brought death. It
was this deity which in turn gave blessing and
destruction, sensual enjoyment and war, birth and
death. She inspired consuming sensual passion, and
then caused death to overtake her lover, even if she
did not slay him herself. Thus a Roman poet can
put into the mouth of a Carthaginian the invocation,
"Goddess Astarte, power of gods and men, life and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
safety, and again destruction, death, and dissolution."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
We find that the Venus of Tyre was called Astarte,
that at Ashtaroth Karnaim, the ancient seat of the
worship of the horned Astarte, the maiden with the
horns of the moon, there was a sanctuary of Atargatis,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
and that fire-festivals were celebrated at Hierapolis in
the sanctuary of Atargatis, which festivals belonged
to Astarte; that the Urania, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the birth-goddess, of
Ascalon, Cyprus, and Cythera became an Aphrodite
Areia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a warlike Aphrodite;<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> that after Cinyras,
the king of Byblus, whose daughters paid service to
the goddess of Byblus with their bodies, Pygmalion
became king, and he regarded with abhorrence the
unchaste daughters of Cinyras, and worshipped the
pure goddess of heaven, and taught how to appease
her anger by human sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> At Carthage a good
goddess of the sky (<i>bona c&#339;lestis</i>) was worshipped
beside an evil one (<i>inferna c&#339;lestis</i>). If human sacrifices
were here burnt to the goddess Dido, just as the
supposed foundress of Carthage is said to have burnt
herself,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> her sister Anna, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the charming one, was
worshipped with cheerful rites. Other accounts mention
that the two sisters Dido and Anna were one
and the same goddess. Without doubt they are right.
We saw that with the Babylonians the planet Venus,
when rising, was the war-goddess Istar, and, when
setting, she was Mylitta, the goddess of love (<a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>).</p>

<p>The relation of the Tyrian goddess Astarte to the
moon has already been touched upon. As goddess
of the moon, she was a changing, wandering deity.
With the waning light of the moon she retired into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the gloom of the west, the region of the setting sun;
and on the disappearance of the goddess on the "bad
evening," the Tyrians performed rites of mourning.
As a "wandering goddess,"<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Astarte was called among
the Phenicians Dido, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the rover, and among the
Westerns Europa, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the dark one.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> With the retirement
of the goddess was connected the legend how
her destructive power was overcome; it showed how
Astarte could be worshipped in Tyre as the wife of
Melkarth, as Milkath (Melecheth, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> queen).<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The
wandering sun-god went in search of the lost goddess.
At length he found her in the remote distance, and
loosed her girdle; the goddess surrendered herself to
him, and sacred marriage changed the warlike goddess
into the friendly deity favourable to procreation,
Astarte into Ashera, Dido into Anna, Artemis or
Athena into Atargatis. The "maiden of the sky"
is now the wife of the god of Tyre, the Hera of the
sky, the Ada (Athe) of the Syrians. From the embraces
of Melkarth and Astarte, the sun-god and the
moon-goddess, and the conquest of the cruel goddess
of war, spring life, order, and law. The sacred
marriage is said to have taken place in the West, at
Samothrace, and further still, on the Cadmeia, the
citadel of Cadmus,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the searching Melkarth,
and finally beyond the pillars of the god, on the
happy islands of the Western Sea, where all fruits of
every kind grew spontaneously, especially the apples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
of life, the pomegranates of Ashera, the apples of the
Hesperides,&mdash;the pledge of love, the symbol of life
and light returning out of darkness. Here also Melkarth
sank down to rest in the streams of the Western
Sea, which his beams had warmed.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>The Syrians did not remain content with combining
the beneficent and destructive powers into one form
only, into Baal-Melkarth and Astarte-Ashera. While
searching for the unity of the divine powers and the
divine nature, they also combined the male and
female deities into one figure, and the creative and
receptive powers were amalgamated in one and the
same form. As the combination of mighty heroic
power with luxurious sensuality is the practical ideal
of the East, so in theory also the highest union of the
powers of nature and divine being, the amalgamation
of male and female is attained by the same combination.
When Astarte had become Ashera, and had
surrendered herself to the god, the god in turn
surrendered himself to the goddess. He plied female
tasks, she carried the weapons. But even their nature
became one, their forms were combined. Astarte and
the Baal placed at her side became one deity. The
male deity of the Moabites was Camos. When Mesha,
king of Moab, took Nebo from the Israelites, he dedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>cated
it to Ashtor-Camos.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> At Carthage Dido-Astarte
was represented with the beard of Melkarth.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> At
Paphos there was a standing image of the bearded
Aphrodite, which was worshipped as a great divinity.
It is this unification which lies at the root of the
legends of Heracles (Melkarth) and Omphale (perhaps,
mother<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>), of Semiramis and Sardanapalus. At certain
festivals of Baal the priests and worshippers of the
androgynous deity appeared in red transparent female
garments, and were otherwise dressed as women, while
the women were dressed as men, and carried swords
and lances.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The law of the Jews strictly forbids the
erection of Astartes and pillars, the bringing of the
hire of the harlot or the pay of the fornicator into the
house of Jehovah, the tearing of the skin, or the
cutting of the hair (which was customary among the
Syrians in different ways as the symbol of the worship
of certain deities), and insists that no eunuch shall
come into the people of Jehovah, that no woman shall
wear a man's clothes, and no man the clothes of a
woman.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>Philo told us above (<a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>) that Eljon of Byblus,
who was called the Highest, was slain in conflict with
wild beasts, and was worshipped by after generations
with libations and sacrifice. In Byblus, under the
name Adonis (Adon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Lord), a god was worshipped,
who was thought to have disappeared, or to have
been carried off in the bloom of youth. Eljon and
Adonis are one and the same form. When the
maritime river named after this deity, the Adonis
(now Nahr Ibrahim), near Byblus, began to run red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
in July (Thammuz), owing to the red earth washed
down from the mountains, then it was believed that
the beautiful Adonis was slain on Libanus by the
savage boar of the war-god. With lamentations and
cries the women sat in the shrine at Byblus; or lingered
by the wayside lamenting the death of Adonis.
They cut off their hair, tore their breasts, and cried
out&mdash;Ailanu, ailanu (woe to us). Adonis was lost, and
was now called Thammuz (the Departed).<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> A time of
lamentation was observed, during which his wooden
image was washed and anointed, and laid upon a bier,
which the priests carried about with their garments
rent and beards shorn. But the god appeared again;
he came to life again, as it seems, with the new spring.
And as the lamentations for his death had been excessive,
so also was the sensuality with which his return
to life was celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Hence we must assume that
in Adonis was personified the vernal sun, the bloom
of vegetation, which so soon begins to droop. If it
was the boar of the war-god, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Moloch, which
slew Adonis, as one account maintains, then in the
minds of the Syrians the destructive sun-god, the
glow of the midsummer sun which makes vegetation
wither, was the cause of the death of Adonis.</p>

<p>Philo further told us of the two sons of the giants,
the brothers Samemrumus and Usous, at Tyre (<a href="#Page_354">p. 354</a>).
The name Samemrumus means the High One of the
Sky, a meaning which is clearly confirmed by the
Greek attribute Hypsuranius. Hence Samemrumus
was the god, the Baal of Tyre, Baal Melkarth. That
Usous also was a god of Tyre is clear from the
observation of Eusebius, that Usous, a man of little
account, had been deified at Tyre beside Melicertes.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Usous, who knew how to catch and destroy wild
animals, and clad himself in their skins, the ancestor
of hunters, reminds us of the Esau of Hebrew tradition.
Compared in point of language the names
of Usous and Esau coincide: "Usous" (Usov) means,
like "Esav," the hairy one. Completely reversing
the natural connection, Philo ascribes to Usous the
erection of the pillars which belong to his brother,
and represents the hunter as embarking on the earliest
ship, whereas Samemrumus, the father of the fisherman,
must have embarked on the first ship. We saw
that the name Sidon means "fish-catchers" (<a href="#Page_344">p. 344</a>).
Hence the legends of the Phenicians carried back the
origin of the Sidonians, to whom not only the city of
Sidon but also Tyre belonged, to Baal Melkarth. From
this god the tribe of the Sidonians, as it seems, pretended
to have sprung. At a later period the mariners
of the coast, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the population of the harbour towns,
looked down with scorn on the shepherds and hunters
of the mountains, although they could not refuse to
recognise the greater antiquity of this mode of life.
Usous, therefore, must be regarded as the elder brother,
the hunter of the mountains, like the Esau of the
Hebrews, while the younger Melkarth takes up his
abode in Tyre. That Usous is the firstborn is clear
from Philo's remark, that Samemrumus rebelled against
his brother. The contrast between the two brothers
is marked by the statement of Eusebius, that Usous
was of little account, more strongly than in Philo.
From this we may perhaps conclude that Usous, the
older god, was originally looked upon as a hostile
power, as Baal Moloch; while in Samemrumus the
friendly, helpful, beneficent power of the deity was
personified as Baal Melkarth. An obscure trace of
the contrast of the two gods is to be found also in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
name Surmubel, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Opponent of Baal, in Philo, which
seems to belong to Baal Melkarth in opposition to
Baal Moloch.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>The gods, whom the various cities of the Phenicians
worshipped as their tutelary deities, were placed
side by side as soon as the feeling of community in
the cities became more lively, and intercourse between
them more vigorous. Hence it came about that a
common worship was also paid to these tutelary
deities. Beside their significance in the natural and
moral world, there resided from antiquity in certain
deities peculiar relations to hunting and agriculture,
and it was natural that as naval occupations, trade,
and industry developed in the cities, the gods should
be brought into relation to these spheres of activity
also. In the same degree as it was felt that trade and
commerce could only prosper amid internal peace and
security in the cities, and under the protection of law
and justice, the gods who maintained order in the
world must become the protectors of order and law
in the cities. In this feeling, and starting from conceptions
of this kind, the priests of the Phenicians
brought the gods of their cities into a connected
system which, following the sacred number seven,
included seven gods. The deities brought into this
circle were known by the collective name Cabirim, i.e.
the "Powerful," the "Great." Among the descendants
of the "field" and the "husbandman," Philo
has already mentioned Misor, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Sydyk (justice).
As powers ruling in justice, law, and equity, and
maintaining order in the cities, the Cabiri are the
children of Sydyk. The Greeks call them children of
the sun-god, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Baal Samim; and if others connect
the Cabiri with Ptah, the god of light among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Egyptians, the conclusion to be drawn is, that it
was Baal Samim who, in his relation to the
Cabiri, was denoted by the name of the Just, the
supreme champion of justice. From the hunter and
the fisher Philo derives Chusor, who discovered the
working of iron; he calls him Heph&aelig;stus (<a href="#Page_354">p. 354</a>).
Chusor, so far as we can tell, was the foremost deity
within the circle of the Cabiri. Phenician coins exhibit
him with a leather apron, hammer, and tongs;
the name seems to denote "arranger." He was the
tutelary god of the life of the cities occupied in navigation
and handicraft. Next to Chusor came a female
deity, Chusarthis, also called Turo (Thorah, law),
whom the Greeks call by the name Harmonia. As
the same deity is also called the goddess of the moon,
we cannot doubt that Chusarthis is Astarte, which is
also sufficiently clear from other evidence; only in the
new system the severe goddess was connected in a
definite manner with the upholding of justice and
preservation of law. Next to Astarte in the series of
the Cabiri comes Baal Melkarth of Tyre, who is known
to the Greeks under the name of Cadmus. He is
regarded as the discoverer of mining and masonry and
the inventor of writing. He searches for the lost
Harmonia, and with her when found celebrates the
sacred marriage. Hence Cadmus could be worshipped
in this system as a life-awakening, phallic god, as well
as the tutelar god of marriage. A peculiar reverence
was enjoyed among the Cabiri by the deity who was
added as an eighth to these seven; his name was
Esmun, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Eighth. In this form it seems that
the peculiarities of the seven gods were taken up and
gathered together. At any rate in Carthage the
temple of Esmun stood in the Byrsa, and on the
highest part of it. In this temple the holiest relics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
of the city were preserved and the most important deliberations
held. The Greeks call Esmun by the name
of Asclepius, but also add that he was different from
the Greek Asclepius. He was, it appears, a healing,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> an appeasing deity, like Jasion in the Cabiric
mysteries of Samothrace. Esmun is also compared
and confounded with Hermes, as with the Thoth of the
Egyptians. Just as Thoth revealed the sacred books
of the Egyptians, did Esmun reveal the sacred books
of the Phenicians. Esmun was represented with a
serpent in his hand as the serpent-holder (Ophiuchus),
and his head as surrounded by eight rays. The forms
of the eight tutelar gods were carved by the Phenicians
on the prows of their ships; it was the Cabiri,
as Philo told us, who discovered the ship. Even now
Phenician coins exhibit the Cabiri in that dwarfed and
distorted form in which the Phenicians loved to
represent the nature and superhuman power of the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>From the circumstance that the Greeks, when
settling in Lemnos, Imbros, Samothrace, and Rhodes,
found the worship of the Cabiri in existence, and
adopted it, though not without certain alterations, we
may conclude that the Cabiric system was established
before the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small> In the tutelary gods of the
sea-loving nation of the Phenicians the Greeks recognised
and worshipped the deities favourable to mariners,
and from this side they combined them with their
own Dioscuri. On the other side the myth of Melkarth
and Astarte, who were adopted into this circle
of divinities, the myth of Melkarth, who discovers the
lost moon-goddess in the land of gloom, and returns
thence with her to new light and life, and who wakes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
to new life after the slumber of the winter, gave the
Greeks an opportunity of connecting with the mysteries
of the Cabiri those conceptions of the life after
death, which grew up among them after the beginning
of the sixth century.</p>

<p>When the great deities had been combined with the
circle of the Cabiri, the subordinate spirits followed in
their course. By degrees a scheme of thrice seven was
reached, a scheme of twenty-one or rather twenty-two
deities, since an eighth was added to the seven
Cabiri. These, beginning with El, were arranged
according to the twenty-two letters of the Phenician
alphabet, and stood in a certain relation to them.
From this number of deities, their various names, and
the order of succession, various schemes of the origin
of the gods were developed, and with the help of
these genealogies certain systems of theogony and
cosmogony were formed, of which the dislocated and
confused fragments were found in Philo; and the
chief of them I have given above. The wind Kolpia
(<a href="#Page_353">p. 353</a>) modern research would explain by Kol-pyah,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "breath of the month;" Baau, the wife of this
wind, by Bohu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Chaos, the Tohu-wa-Bohu of the
Hebrews. The more abstract the potentialities with
which these systems begin, the later we may assume
their origin to be.</p>

<p>Like the Arabs, the Syrians originally worshipped
their gods upon the mountains and in stones; then
they erected pillars of wood and stone to them, and
images, figures of bulls, or shapes combined from the
forms of men and fish. They also erected statues
male and female, or androgynous. At the great
festivals the sacred tents and chests in which ancient
symbols and tokens of the deities were preserved, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
the images of the gods, were carried round in solemn
procession.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Of the festival in the temple of Atargatis,
at Hierapolis, we have already spoken (<a href="#Page_360">p. 360</a>); of
the fire-festival which the Tyrians held in the spring,
Lucian tells us: "They trim great trees, set them up
in the court of the temple, and bring goats, sheep,
birds, and other victims. These they fasten to the
trees, and in addition, clothes and gold and silver
jewellery. After these preliminaries they carry the
images of the gods round the trees; the pyre is then
kindled, and all consumed."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>As we may conclude from Lucian's account and
from ruins, the temples were on a tolerably extensive
scale. There were two or three courts, one after the
other, either rectangular as at Paphus and Marathus,
or oval, as at Malta and Gaulus, surrounded by strong
walls, and furnished with pillars, altars, and pools of
water. With these was connected a narrow and small
shrine, containing the sacred stone or image. The
tithes belonged to the gods. Every year, at the
festival of Melkarth, in Tyre, an embassy appeared
from Carthage which offered to the god of the mother
city the tenth of the revenue of their state, and after
great victories the Carthaginians probably sent a tenth
of the spoil to the gods of Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> The number of
priests was great; we often find hundreds engaged in
a single sacrifice,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and the ritual was complicated.
The human sacrifices, mutilation, and prostitution, by
which the Syrians sought to win the favour of their
deities, we have already heard of. At a later time
at all the great sanctuaries there were thousands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
male and female servants beside the priests. The
priests lived on the tithes, the temple lands, and
the part which fell to them in the sacrifices. The
ritual distinguished burnt offerings, offerings of
purification, expiatory offerings, and offerings of the
first fruits; besides animals and the firstlings of the
field, sacrificial cakes were frequently offered. The
bull was the most acceptable victim; cows were not
sacrificed, nor the flesh eaten. Beside bulls, rams
and he-goats, and of birds, the dove, the partridge,
the quail, and the goose were offered. The animals
were required to be pure, without blemish, of the
male sex, and capable of procreation. To guard
against the offering of unclean beasts, the priests of
Hierapolis refused to sacrifice any but those bought
from themselves.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Two Phenician inscriptions of
Massilia and Carthage have come down to us from
the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, containing the edicts of the
Carthaginian Suffetes about the part of the sacrifice
belonging to the priests, the fee to be paid for the
sacrifice, and finally the price of the victims purchased
of the priests. The Carthaginian inscription lays
down the rule that of a bull, a ram, or a goat, offered
as a burnt-offering, the skin was to be the property of
the priests and the inwards the property of the person
presenting the victim. Moreover, of every victim
offered, the cut and roasted flesh went to the priests.
On the other hand, the inscription of Massilia gives
the skin to those who present the victim (the law of the
Hebrews also gives the skin of a burnt-offering to the
man who offers the victim), but according to this
decree the victims must be bought from the priests.
For a bull ten shekels were to be paid to them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
though the tariff at Carthage lays upon the sacrificer
a fee of only 2 <i>sus</i> for each head of fowl sacrificed,
the inscription of Massilia raises the fee to 3/4 of a
shekel and 2 sus.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

who is sought by Cadmus the son of Ph&#339;nix. In her crescent and cow's
horns they also recognise their Argive Moon-goddess, Io, and represent her
as wandering to Ph&#339;nicia and Egypt, where Isis, who here again wears the
cow's horns or head, or is entirely represented as a cow, becomes their
Io. The wanderings of Dido-Astarte then became confused with the
stories of Helena, with the wanderings and fortunes of the foundress of
Carthage, and the travels of &AElig;neas, the favourite of Aphrodite, were
directed to the most famous seats of the worship of Ashera.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGIN AND DESCENT OF THE HEBREWS.</h3>


<p>The tradition of the Hebrews of the early history and
fortunes of their people previous to the settlement in
Canaan is contained in the books of the Pentateuch.
After they had settled in that land and had passed
beyond the loose combination of their tribes to the
unity of civic life, after a monarchy had been established,
and under it a metropolis and a centre for the
national religion had been founded, the priesthood
engaged in this worship began to collect together
ritualistic observances and customs of law, and to
write them down in combination with anything still
living about their early history in the traditions
of their families. The Hebrews had found existing
in Canaan that ancient and many-sided civilisation
the nature and extent of which we have already
attempted to describe. Of their own history they
could have preserved nothing but prominent facts and
decisive crises. Songs of praise and victory which
celebrated the great events of the Hebrew past, such
as the exodus from Egypt and the victories won over
the Canaanites, of which some were already written
down,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> forms of blessing, genealogies,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> isolated frag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>ments
of the moral law, or time-honoured sacrificial
custom, or ancient rules of justice,<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> and finally narration
of the wars,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> constituted fixed points of connection
in this tradition. At the new centre of religious
worship the whole stock of existing ritual and custom
had to be brought under review, and from hence
provision made for the use of the true and acceptable
kind of sacrifice, and sentence of law. The consideration
of the marvellous lot which had fallen to
the Hebrews, the rise of a feeble shepherd tribe under
the powerful protection of Egypt, the liberation from
the dominion of this great kingdom, the conquest of
Canaan, the capture of ancient and strongly-fortified
cities, "of fields which they had not tilled, of vineyards
and olive-gardens which they had not planted, of wells
which they had not dug, of cities which they had not
builded," caused the Hebrews to recognise in the favour
which had attended them the direct guidance of their
deity. This grace would remain with them if they continued
to worship the god of their fathers according to
his will, in the way acceptable to him. Thus to the
priests, who undertook the task of writing down the
tradition, the nation appeared as a chosen people from
the beginning, to whom their god had early given
his blessing. In return for such grace and beneficence
the Hebrews had to obey his law. This is the
"covenant" which Jehovah has made with them.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> This
law, therefore, must be carefully recorded, in order that
it may be obeyed exactly in every particular by the
priests themselves, as by the judges and all the nation.</p>

<p>On the basis of this tradition, these songs and
poems, genealogies and ancient records, and under the
guidance of the views just pointed out, there arose at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Hebron, in the first decade of the reign of David,
within the circle of a priestly family, which apparently
claimed to be sprung from Aaron, the brother of
Moses, the Jud&aelig;an text of the Pentateuch, and the
Book of Joshua.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Composed as annals, this text deals
primarily with the connection and course of the
fortunes of Israel; the central point is the covenant
between Jehovah (Elohim) and Israel, Israel and
Jehovah, and the law, which is the body of this
covenant.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The unity of religious worship and the
centralisation of it at one place and one only is
brought prominently forward, and this could not have
happened till political unity had been obtained, a
metropolis founded, and a seat erected there for the
worship of the whole nation, or at least contemplated,
if not erected. The law for the priests, the minute
details of ritual which make up the chief part of this
text, were, in the view of the priests, given at that
mighty time when Moses led the people; though, as
a matter of fact, only a few of the fundamental
precepts reached so far back (see below). The centralisation
of the worship also at one place of sacrifice,
the command to have a common place of worship, was
thought to have been in existence as early as the time
of Moses, and to have been prescribed even when the
Hebrews were in the desert. And the priests were
more inclined to believe that the ideal sought after
for their religion, for Church and State, belonged to
the time of Moses, because in those days of piety and
exaltation the true ordinances must have been in
existence, and certain sacrificial institutions, certain
principles of law and morality, actually came down
from that period.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after this first text arose a second, which,
however, can hardly have been composed in priestly
circles, and certainly did not come from Judah.
With the author of this second text, it is not the
collection and establishment of the law, and the
desire to insist on the obedience to it, which is the
main point. It is rather the personal fortunes of the
fathers of the race, in which the divine guidance is
shown, the manifestations of the deity in their favour,
the revelations made to them by divine messengers,
the importance of old customs and old names, on
which he lays especial weight. He also availed
himself of older written sources.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> The language and
style of this second text are more lively, versatile,
and distinct than those of the first; and the importance
which he ascribes to the fortunes of Joseph and
the tribes of Ephraim confirms the assumption that
the author belonged to this tribe. The origin of this
second text falls in the second half of Solomon's reign,
or immediately after it&mdash;in the decades from 970 to
950 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>About a hundred years later, towards the middle of
the ninth century <small>B.C.</small>, both these texts were combined
and transformed into one work. The author of
this combined text (the Jahvist) was guided by the
feelings and views of the prophets. He is superior to
the authors of the two texts in versatility, in reflection,
and vivid power of imagination. Not only
did he work up the two texts into one and insert
into the whole his own views, but he has added
some sections, the materials of which must have
been furnished partly by tradition and partly by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
written records.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> In this shape were the first four
books of the Pentateuch, the beginning and the end
of the fifth book, and the book of Joshua, at the time
of the prophets Amos and Hosea. The "Second
Law," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the main portion of the fifth book of the
Pentateuch,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> on the other hand, was not written till
the time of king Josiah, about 625 <small>B.C.</small>, and was then
added to the rest. The author of this second law
also revised the book of Joshua.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>If we compare the Hebrew account of the Creation
with the cosmogonies of Berosus and Philo (pp. <a href="#Page_257">257</a>,
<a href="#Page_353">353</a>), and the narrative of Noah's deluge with the
description of the flood on the Assyrian tablets and in
Berosus (<a href="#Page_240">p. 240 ff.</a>), we see at the first glance how far
asunder the conceptions lie&mdash;with what clearness and
vigour the Hebrews have succeeded in purifying and
exalting the rude fancies of the nations so closely
akin to them&mdash;the ancient common possession of the
Eastern Semitic tribes, from whom the Hebrews were
sprung. This power&mdash;the patient labour, the serious
and thoughtful effort to deepen the traditions of the
past into an ethical significance, to sublimate legends
into simple moral teaching, and transplant the myth
into the region of moral earnestness and moral purpose&mdash;to
pass beyond the rude naturalism of their
kinsmen into the supernatural&mdash;from the varied
polytheism of Babel and Canaan to monotheism&mdash;this
it is which gives to the Hebrews the first place, and
not among Semitic nations only, in the sphere of
religious feeling and development. At a later period
the Greeks understood how to breathe life, beauty
and nobility into the gods of the Phenicians, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
rites came over to Hellas; they could change Ashera-Bilit,
the goddess of prostitution, into the youthful
Aphrodite, the goddess of blooming grace, and the
highest charm of love; but the Hebrews practised the
severer, sterner, and loftier task of carrying religious
feeling beyond the life of nature, of conceiving the
highest power as morally in opposition to natural
impulses and forces, of publishing the supremacy of
the intellectual and moral over the natural being.</p>

<p>Adam begot Seth, so we are told in the first book
of the Pentateuch, and Seth begot Enos, and Enos
begot Kenan, and Kenan begot Mahalaleel, and
Mahalaleel begot Jared, and Jared begot Enoch, and
Enoch begot Methuselah, and Methuselah begot
Lamech, and Lamech begot Noah, and Noah begot
Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The earth was full of
evil, but Noah walked with God. Then God said to
Noah: Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood, 300
cubits in length, 50 cubits in breadth, and 30 cubits
in height. For I will send a flood upon the earth to
destroy under the heaven all flesh wherein is the
breath of life. But with thee I make my covenant;
and thou shalt go into the ark, thou and thy three
sons and thy wife, and the three wives of thy sons
with thee. And of all living creatures thou shalt
bring two into the ark, male and female shall they
be. And Noah did as God commanded him. When
Noah was 600 years old, in the second month, on
the seventeenth day of the month, the fountains
of the deep were broken up, and the windows
of heaven were opened, and there was rain on the
earth for forty days and forty nights, and the
waters rose and lifted the ark. And the flood was
mighty, and all the high mountains that are under
heaven were covered; the water rose fifteen cubits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
above the tops of the mountains. For 150 days the
flood was mighty on the earth. Then God caused a
wind to blow, and the waters sank. And in the
seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month,
the ark rested on the mountains of the land of Ararat;
and in the tenth month, on the first day, the tops of
the mountains appeared. It came to pass after forty
days, that Noah opened the window of the ark, and
sent out a raven; but it flew to and fro. Then he
sent out a dove, to see whether the water had retired
from the earth. But the dove found no place of rest,
and returned to the ark. And Noah remained seven
days more, and again sent out the dove. Then the
dove came to him at evening, and lo! a fresh olive-branch
was in her mouth. And he remained yet
seven days, and again sent out the dove, but she
returned to him no more. Then Noah opened the
door of the ark and looked out, and lo! the earth was
dry. And in the second month, on the seventeenth
day of the month, the earth was dry. And Noah
went out of the ark, and his sons, and his wife, and
the wives of his sons, and he built an altar to Jehovah,
and took of all clean beasts and birds and offered a
burnt sacrifice upon the altar. After the flood sons
were born to the sons of Noah. The sons of Shem
were Elam and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud and
Aram. Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber.
Eber had two sons, the name of the one was Peleg,
and the name of the other Joktan. Peleg begot Reu,
and Reu begot Serug, and Serug begot Nahor, and
Nahor begot Terah.</p>

<p>Terah dwelt in the land of his nativity at Ur in
Chald&aelig;a, and his sons were Abraham, Nahor, and
Haran. Haran begot Lot and Milcah and Iscah, and
died before his father at Ur in Chald&aelig;a. Nahor took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Milcah to wife, and Abraham took Sarah. And Terah
went with Abraham his son, and Lot the son of
Haran, from Ur in Chald&aelig;a to Haran and dwelt there.
But Jehovah said to Abraham: "Go from thy land,
and thy home, and thy father's house, to a land which
I will show thee." Then Abraham took Sarah his
wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their goods,
and the souls born to them in Haran, and went forth
from Haran. He came unto the land of Canaan as
far as Sichem and to the oak Moreh, and there he
built to Jehovah an altar; and afterwards he went
towards the mountain and pitched his tent between
Bethel and Ai, and there he built an altar to Jehovah,
and journeyed towards the south. And when the
famine was sore in the land, Abraham, and Lot with
him, went to Egypt, and Pharaoh, for Sarah's sake,
gave Abraham sheep and oxen and asses, and men-servants,
and maid-servants, and she-asses, and
camels. But Jehovah smote Pharaoh with great
plagues, so that he let Abraham and Sarah go, and
bade men guide him.</p>

<p>Then Abraham dwelt again at Bethel, and was very
rich in flocks, in silver and gold. Lot also had tents
and sheep and oxen, and there was a strife between
the shepherds of Abraham and the shepherds of Lot.
Then Abraham said to Lot: "Let there be no strife
between my shepherds and thine, for we are brethren.
If thou wilt go to the left hand, I will go to the
right." Then Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw the land
of Jordan, that it was watered as a garden of the
Lord; and he set forth at morning, and pitched his
tents at Sodom. But Jehovah said to Abraham: "Lift
up thine eyes; the whole land which thou seest I will
give to thee and thy seed for ever; rise up and go
through the length and breadth of the land, for I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
give it to thee." And Abraham pitched his tents
under the oaks, which are at Kirjath-Arba (Hebron),
and there built an altar to Jehovah.</p>

<p>For twelve years the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah,
of Adamah, Zeboiim and Zoar, had served Kedor-Laomer,
king of Elam. Then they rebelled; and in
the fourteenth year Kedor-Laomer, and the kings who
were with him, Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Tidal
and Arioch of Elassar, smote the Rephaims at
Ashtaroth-Karnaim, the Zuzims at Ham, and the
Emims at Shaveh-Kiriathaim, and the Horites on
their mountain of Seir, and smote the whole land of
the Amalekites and Amorites. The kings of Sodom
and Gomorrah also, of Adamah, Zeboiim and Zoar,
who had drawn out against them in the valley of
Siddim, were put to flight, and fled to the mountains,
and all the goods and all the food in Sodom and
Gomorrah were taken, and they also took Lot and his
goods. When Abraham heard that his brother's son
was carried away, he set forth with his servants, 318
in number, and fell upon them by night at Dan, and
pursued them as far as Hobah, which is to the west of
Damascus, and brought back all the goods and Lot
and the people that were captured. The king of
Sodom came to him and said: Give me the souls, and
take the goods for thyself. But Abraham said: I
lift up my hand to Jehovah that I will take nothing
of thee, save what my servants have eaten.</p>

<p>Abraham dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan,
but his wife bore him no son. But he had an
Egyptian maid-servant whose name was Hagar. Her
Sarah gave him to wife, and Hagar was with child,
and the angel of Jehovah announced to her that she
should bear a son who would be like a wild ass, and
his hand would be against every man and every man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
hand against him, and he would dwell to the east of
his brethren. And Hagar bore Abraham a son, and
Abraham named him Ishmael. Then he received the
promise that Sarah also should bear a son, "from
whom should arise kings and nations;" and when he
was 100 years old, and in the south between Kadesh
and Sur, Sarah bore him a son. Abraham named
him Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight
days old. The year before he had circumcised
Ishmael, for God had said: This is the covenant
which thou shalt keep between me and thee, and thy
seed after thee, that every male shall be circumcised.</p>

<p>When Isaac grew up and Sarah saw the son of the
Egyptian woman, she said to Abraham: Thrust out
this woman and her son; Ishmael shall not be heir
with Isaac. Then Abraham gave Hagar bread and a
bottle of water on her shoulders, and sent her forth
with her child. She wandered into the desert of
Beersheba, i.e. the well of the seven, and when
the water was spent, and the child was fainting with
thirst, she laid him down under a bush, and sat down
a bow-shot from him, and said: "Let me not see the
death of the child." Then Jehovah heard the voice
of the child, and His angel called to Hagar out of
heaven: "Fear not, rise up, and take the boy in thy
hand, Jehovah will make him a great people." And
Jehovah opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
water, and filled the bottle, and gave her child
drink. And Jehovah was with him; he grew up
in the desert, and was an archer, and dwelt in the
desert of Paran, and his mother took him a wife
out of Egypt, and Ishmael begot Nebajoth, and
Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, and Mishma, and
Dumah, and Massa, and Hadar, and Tema, and
Jetur, and Naphish, and Kedemah, twelve princes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
And Ishmael died 137 years old, and his descendants
dwelt to the east of his brethren from Shur, which
lies before Egypt, to Havilah, and towards Asshur.</p>

<p>Abraham abode a long time in the land of the
Philistines. And God tempted Abraham, and bade
him sacrifice his only son Isaac, in the land of Moriah,
as a burnt offering. But when Abraham had built
the altar on the top of the mountain, and laid the
wood upon it, and bound Isaac and laid him on
the altar, and taken the knife and stretched forth
his hand to slay his son, the angel of Jehovah called
from heaven, saying: Lay not thine hand on the
lad, for now I know that thou fearest God; thou
hast not refused Him thine only son. And Abraham
saw a ram caught in the thicket, and he sacrificed
him.</p>

<p>When Sarah died at Hebron, Abraham spoke to
the Hittites among whom he dwelt: I am a stranger
and a sojourner among you; give me a burying-place
for my people among you, that I may put away my
dead from me. Speak for me with Ephron, the
son of Zohar, that he give me the cave of Machpelah
which is his, at the corner of his field; let him give
it to me for a burying-place at its full worth in
money. Ephron agreed, and Abraham weighed the
money to Ephron, four hundred shekels of silver,
current money with the merchant. And thus the
field of Ephron at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre,
that is Hebron, the field and the cave, and all the
trees on the field and round it, were given to Abraham
before the eyes of the Hittites, and the eyes of all
who went into the gates of the city. And Abraham
buried Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah.</p>

<p>Then Abraham took another wife, whose name was
Keturah, and she bore him Zimram, and Jokshan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
But Isaac had grown a man, and Abraham said
to his servant, the oldest in his house, Eliezer of
Damascus: Lay thy hand under my thigh; I charge
thee that thou take not to my son a wife from
the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom we
dwell; to my fatherland and my home thou shalt
go, and there seek a wife for Isaac. Then the servant
took ten camels from the camels of his master, and
goods of every kind, and passed over the Euphrates
towards Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor, the brother
of Abraham. To Nahor his wife Milcah, the daughter
of Haran, had borne eight sons. The youngest was
Bethuel, and Bethuel's son was Laban, and his
daughter Rebekah. Eliezer came to the city of
Nahor at evening, and halted his camels at the well
outside the city. Then came a maiden, fair to behold,
with her pitcher on her shoulder, to the well. When
she had filled her pitcher and come up from the well,
the servant went to her and said: Bend down thy
pitcher and let me drink a little water. Drink, my
lord, she answered, and quickly took the pitcher in
her hand, and gave him to drink. Then she said:
I will draw also for thy camels, and stepped down
again to the well. Eliezer marvelled at her; and
when all the camels had drunk, he took a golden
ring, half a shekel in weight, and two golden bracelets,
ten shekels in weight, and put the ring in her nose,
and the bracelets on her arm, and then inquired whose
daughter she was, and whether there was room in her
father's house to shelter him and the camels. And
she answered: I am Rebekah, the daughter of
Bethuel, the son of Nahor; straw and fodder is
in abundance with us, and room for the camels.
And her brother Laban came to the well, and led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
Eliezer to the house, and Laban took the saddles
from the camels, spread straw for them, and gave
them fodder and brought water for his guest to
wash his feet, and food. But Eliezer said: I will
not eat till I have given my message. I am the
servant of Abraham, and Jehovah has blessed my
master, so that he has become great, and he has
given him sheep and oxen, and silver and gold, and
men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels and
asses. And Sarah has borne a son to my master
in his old age, and I have sworn to seek a wife
for his son from his home and his own people; and
Jehovah led me in the right path in order to take
the granddaughter of the brother of my master for
his son. If ye are willing to plight troth and love
with Abraham, say it. Then said Bethuel, Rebekah's
father, and Laban her brother: Behold, the maiden
stands before thee, take her and go. Then Eliezer
brought forth gold and silver ornaments, and garments,
and gave them to Rebekah; to her brother also and
her mother he gave gifts. And when Laban and his
mother sent away Rebekah with her nurse Deborah,
and Abraham's servant Eliezer, they blessed Rebekah,
and said: Become a thousand times a thousand, and
may thy seed possess the gate of thy enemies. When
Eliezer returned home, he told all that he had done,
and Isaac received Rebekah into the tent of his
mother, and she became his wife, and he loved her.
And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac; but
to Ishmael and the sons of Keturah he gave gifts,
and sent them away from his son Isaac into the
land to the East. Then Abraham, after he had lived
175 years, died at a good old age, and his sons Isaac
and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah.</p>

<p>These narratives show that the Hebrews derived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
the origin of their nation from the land of the
Euphrates and Tigris. We remarked above that
the legend of the Deluge could only have arisen in
river valleys, exposed to severe inundations (<a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>).
If we set aside the additions made in the prophetic
revision, the narrative of the flood belongs to the
first text; in this text therefore the nations of
the earth were derived from the sons of Noah. The
revision adds that the descendants of Noah, in their
journey from the East, found a plain in the land
of Shinar, i.e. Babylonia, and dwelt there, and erected
a city and a tower, intended to reach to heaven.
Then Jehovah confounded their language and scattered
them over the earth.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> But it is the first text
which gives the genealogy of Abraham, according
to which the descendant of Noah, Terah, the father
of Abraham, dwells in the land of his nativity, at Ur
in Chald&aelig;a. We found that Ur lay on the lower
Euphrates, where the ruins of Mugheir mark its site,
that the oldest buildings in Babylonia belong to
this place, and the oldest sovereigns on the Euphrates
called themselves kings of Ur (<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>). From Ur
Terah, according to the first text, journeyed with
his family to Haran.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Haran lies in a wide plain
surrounded by hills on the Skirtos, a tributary of
the Belik, at no great distance from the Euphrates;
it is the Carrhae of western writers. From Haran
Abraham turns towards Canaan; but his brother's
tribe remains in Haran. Hence, as the oldest
writings of the Hebrews without any doubt derive
the progenitors of the nation from Ur and Carrhae
in the land of the Euphrates, so later authorities
maintain, as an absolute certainty, that "the fathers
dwelt beyond the river," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Euphrates. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
the "second law" Abraham is called a "wandering
Aram&aelig;an," and Ezekiel calls Chald&aelig;a "the birthplace
of the Hebrews."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The name "Hebrews"
confirms this statement and view. Heber means
"that which is beyond," "those who dwell beyond."
The Hebrews call themselves the sons of Israel;
the name of Hebrews they received from the Canaanites,
into whose land they forced a way, though the
Canaanites, no doubt, meant no more by the name
than that the sons of Israel dwelt on the other side
of the Jordan, before they set foot in Canaan.</p>

<p>But the genealogy of the Hebrews goes far beyond
Carrh&aelig; and Ur. After enumerating the ten patriarchs
from Adam, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from the man "formed of earth"
(adama) to Noah, and giving the age of these patriarchs
in hundreds of years (the highest age is 969, and
the lowest is the seventh, 365), the first text enumerates
another set of ten patriarchs from the sons of Noah
down to Abraham, and of these the age gradually
dwindles from 600 to 175 years.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The head of this
series, Shem, the eldest son of Noah, the friend of
God, is the immediate progenitor of the Hebrews.
That the recollection and feeling of the relationship
with the inhabitants of the land of the two streams,
and with the population of Aram, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the upper
land between the Tigris and Euphrates, the Euphrates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
and the Jordan, and with portions of the inhabitants
of Arabia and Asia Minor, was alive and present in
the minds of the Hebrews, is clear from the fact that
these nations, akin in tribe and blood and language,
were carried back to Shem. From Arphaxad, the
third son of Shem, sprang the fathers of the Hebrews;
the two first sons Elam and Asshur, we already know
as the progenitors of the Elamites and Assyrians. From
Lud and Aram, the fourth and fifth sons of Shem, the
Lydians and Aram&aelig;eans were derived, a genealogy
which certainly belongs to the Ephraimitic, if not
to the Jud&aelig;an text. In Arphaxad, the name of the
third son, we cannot mistake the name of a district
any more than in the names of the other sons.
Arphaxad is a mountain canton of South Armenia,
between the lakes of Van and Urumiah,&mdash;the Arrapachitis<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>
of the Greeks, the Alpak of the Armenians,
the modern Albak&mdash;and lies more than 6,000 feet high,
at the source of the Great Zab, which also flows
through it.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The son of Arphaxad is Salah, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
"leaving," "departure," and the son of Salah is Eber,
in whom we have the later name of the Israelites,
transformed into a patriarch. To Eber two sons are
allotted. The name of the elder, Peleg, means
division, "because in his time the earth was divided."
From this we may draw the conclusion that the
division of the descendants of Noah and the separation
of the nations was transferred to the fifth generation
after him. But another meaning may also be given on
linguistic grounds to the name Peleg (Phaleg), and at
the juncture of the Chaboras and the Euphrates we
find a place of the name of Phalga.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Joktan, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
second son of Eber, we know already as the father of
those Arabian tribes who dwell from Mesha to
Dshafar, and in Kachtan we have already found his
name in Arab tradition (<a href="#Page_326">p. 326</a>). The descendants
of Peleg, the elder son of Eber, are Reu, and Serug the
son of Reu. The name Serug appears to have been
retained in the district of Serug, and the modern
Serudsh, south-west of Edessa, in the neighbourhood
of the Euphrates. Western writers speak of the
district of Osrhoene, and give this name to the south-west
of Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Serug's son is Nahor, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
"the river," the Euphrates. Nahor is followed by
Terah, who had his home at Ur.</p>

<p>If this series of the first text preserved a genuine
historical recollection, a portion of a Semitic tribe,
settled in the mountains of South Armenia, or even
the whole tribe&mdash;the sons of Arphaxad&mdash;journeyed to
the south, after leaving nothing but their name in the
mountain valley. The separation from their kindred
was signified by the name Salah, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "leaving." At
first the sons of Arphaxad pastured their flocks at
Serudsh, in the north-west of Mesopotamia, and from
thence they passed to Ur on the lower Euphrates,
while another branch, the sons of Joktan, turned away
from the mouth of the Euphrates in the direction of
Arabia. At a later time the sons of Arphaxad settled
at Ur must again have marched up the Euphrates to
Carrhae. Then followed a second division; one
portion, the Nahorites, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the people of the river,
remained at Carrhae, while others, the Abrahamites,
wandered to Canaan, or rather into the deserts bordering
on Canaan. Moreover, since the first text denotes
Abraham's eldest son Ishmael, as the progenitor of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Ishmaelites, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of a considerable number of tribes of
North and Central Arabia, and since the revision
derives the Midianites, who wandered on the peninsula
of Sinai, and further in the East, and other Arabian
tribes, from the sons of Keturah, the younger sons
of Abraham (pp. <a href="#Page_324">324</a>, <a href="#Page_393">393</a>), it follows that on the
borders of Canaan a portion of the Abrahamites must
again have broken off, and passed on to the peninsula
of Arabia.</p>

<p>However this may be, the kinship of the Hebrews
with the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Aram&aelig;ans, the
derivation of their tribe from the river-land of the
Euphrates and Tigris, is beyond a doubt, and we
must regard the districts of Arphaxad and Serug,
of Ur and Carrh&aelig;, as the original home of the
tribe, which afterwards grew up to be the Hebrews.
In any case it is clear from this genealogical table that
the Hebrews considered themselves closely allied to
the Nahorites of Haran, but more especially to a
considerable number of the Arabian tribes, or
Ishmaelites, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Nebajoths, the Kedarites, the
Temanites, the Jeturites, and finally the Midianites.
This is proved, not only by the derivation of the
Ishmaelites from the eldest son of Abraham, but also
by the close relationship in which the Edomites, the
brothers of the Hebrews, are represented as standing
to the Ishmaelites. The names Ishmael and Israel are
similarly formed; the first means "God (El) hears,"
the second, "God strives," or "God rules."</p>

<p>Within this circle of kindred nations, the Hebrews
occupy the foremost place. The Ishmaelites are
descended, it is true, from the eldest son of Abraham;
but not from a legitimate or equal marriage; the
mother of their tribe is a maid-servant and an
Egyptian. Ishmael's wife also came from Egypt, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>,
in this there may linger a dim recollection of the
ancient supremacy of the Hyksos in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The
Midianites, on the other hand, spring from a younger
branch than the Hebrews; and they too are not born
from the true wife of Abraham, and hence are not his
genuine heirs. To the Moabites also, who pastured
their flocks to the east of the Dead Sea, and the
Ammonites, whose land lay to the north-east of this
sea, the Hebrews held themselves akin. These tribes
are the descendants of Lot, Abraham's brother's son;
and therefore they, like the Hebrews themselves,
spring from those who had moved from Carrhae to
the West. But Lot had separated from Abraham, and
chosen the region of Jordan. And when Jehovah
rained fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah,
because the sins of their inhabitants were grievous, and
overthrew these cities, and the whole land around
them, Lot with his two daughters escaped towards
the East; but because all the men of Sodom were
destroyed, there was no man to dwell with Lot's
daughters. Then they gave their father wine to
drink, and lay with him, and the elder bore Moab,
and the younger Ammon. Thus although the
Moabites and Ammonites are closely allied to the
Hebrews, and are of the pure stock&mdash;they were
begotten in incest. A dark stain rests on their
origin. Obviously the bitter hostility which afterwards
prevailed between the Hebrews, and the
Moabites and Ammonites, and the severe wounds
which the Hebrews suffered from the attacks of these
nations, have had their influence in forming and
moulding the story of their origin. The Jud&aelig;an text<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
narrated quite simply the separation of Abraham and
Lot, the choice of the land of Jordan, the destruction
of the cities, and Lot's escape.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> The broader details
and motives given in the narrative are the work of the
prophetic revision, to which the account of the origin
of the Moabites and Ammonites exclusively belongs.</p>

<p>To the Hebrews, the wanderings and fortunes of
their forefathers appeared compressed into the lives of
the patriarchs, whose mighty forms are also to them
the patterns of morality, piety, and a life pleasing to
God, the expression of the genuine national character.
The name Abraham means, in the form ab-ram, "high
father;" in the form ab-raham, "father of the multitude."
Sarah means "princess." Their right to the
possessions, which they won in Canaan by the sword,
they saw in the command given to their ancestors to
go thither, and in the promise that the land should
belong to his seed, which is given to Abraham, even in
the first text. Moreover, the purchase which Abraham
concluded with the Hittites of Hebron of a burying-place
for his wife and himself in the cave of Machpelah&mdash;this
narrative is a part of the Jud&aelig;an text&mdash;and the
services rendered by Abraham to Canaan gave to his
descendants a claim to the possession of Canaan.
Abraham planted the trees at Beersheba, and dug
wells; he defended Canaan against Kedor-Laomer, and
recovered from the kings of the east the booty taken,
without keeping back any for himself. These services
of the progenitor also constituted a claim for his
descendants.</p>

<p>The accounts in Genesis<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> of campaigns of Elamite
rulers towards the west, and the supremacy of a king
of Elam, one of the Kudurids, over Syria, are founded
on events and circumstances which occurred about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
the year 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, as has been already pointed
out in detail (<a href="#Page_251">p. 251</a>). The connection into which
Abraham is brought with them is the work of the
Hebrews, and belongs to the Ephraimitic text.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> The
account which puts the Horites, who occupied Mount
Seir before the Edomites, among the nations conquered
by the Elamites, and beside these certain extinct and
mythical tribes&mdash;the Rephaites, Susites, and Emites&mdash;shows
plainly that the events must belong to a very
distant past.</p>

<p>When the rights of the Hebrews to Canaan had
been proved, when at the same time it was ascertained
that the kindred tribes of Moab and Ammon could
establish no claim to the land, after the voluntary
renunciation of their progenitor, it remained to be
shown that the ancient inhabitants of the land, the
Canaanites themselves, had been from the first
destined to give way to the Hebrews. We found that
the Canaanites, like the Hebrews, belonged to the
great family of the Semitic nations; but they were
distinguished from them in character, in dialect, and
religious conceptions. Hence they were not derived
from Shem, but from Noah's second son, Ham; and
they were also burdened with the curse of Noah&mdash;a
trait which the prophetic reviser has added to the
narrative.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> After the flood, Noah planted a vineyard,
and he became drunken, and uncovered
himself in his tent; and Ham, the father of Canaan,
saw the nakedness of his father, but Shem and Japhet
went backwards and covered him. And when Noah
heard what Ham had done, he said, "Cursed be Ham;
a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>Abraham passed through the length and breadth of
Canaan, the land which his descendants were destined
to possess. At Shechem and Hebron, and then in the
south, at Kadesh (Barnea) and Shur, he abode longest;
at Hebron, and between Bethel and Ai, he built
an altar to Jehovah. The presence of the patriarchs
consecrated the places where his descendants were
to dwell; among the Hittites and the Canaanites
Abraham remained true to the God who had led
him into Canaan; he rendered a willing obedience
even to the harshest command. At the places where
Abraham had set up altars, and where he had offered
sacrifice, we find at a later period centres of Hebrew
worship: by Abraham's sacrifices they were already
consecrated. The Jud&aelig;an text places the abode of
Abraham mainly in the south of Canaan, at Hebron;
the south belonged mainly to the tribe of Judah, and
Hebron was David's royal abode till he conquered
Jerusalem from the Jebusites. The Ephraimitic text
placed Abraham mainly at Shechem, the chief city of
the tribe of Ephraim, and gives especial prominence
to the sacred place at Bethel. The wandering of
Abraham from the south of Canaan to Egypt, where
the Pharaoh, warned by plagues from Jehovah, sends
him away with valuable presents and in peace, is the
work of the reviser. It is an anticipation of the
later sojourn of the Hebrews in Egypt, and forms at
the same time a contrast to the widely different
circumstances of their exodus.</p>

<p>After long waiting, the true son is at length born
to the patriarch from his wife, of the blood of his
fathers in Haran.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> In order to preserve the blood
of the Hebrews pure, a wife is not taken from
Canaan for this son, Isaac, but the care of the father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
provides a wife from among his kindred, the tribe of
the Nahorites, on the Euphrates. The first text tells
us quite briefly, "Isaac was forty years old when he
took to wife Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the
Aram&aelig;an of Mesopotamia, the sister of Laban the
Aram&aelig;an."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> The lively description of the journey
and the suit of Eliezer is the work of the reviser of
the two original texts. After thus providing for the
continuance of the pure stock, when the oldest son,
the child of Hagar, and the younger sons, the children
of Keturah, had been sent away with presents, as
the law of the Hebrews afterwards ordained for the
sons of concubines, and directed to the East, when
he had given everything into the hand of Isaac,
Abraham died full of years and blessings.</p>

<p>Isaac was now sixty years old&mdash;such is the account
given in Genesis&mdash;and his wife Rebekah, the daughter
of Bethuel, the sister of Laban, had borne him no son.
Then Isaac besought Jehovah for his wife, and Jehovah
heard him. Rebekah became with child, and lo! there
were twins in her womb, and the children strove in
her womb; and Jehovah said to her: Two nations are
in thy body, and two people shall separate from thy
bosom. The first boy was red in colour, and hairy,
and she called him Esau; and afterwards his brother
came out, and his hand was upon Esau's heel, and he
was called Jacob, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "one that holds the heel." And
the boys grew; and Esau was a hunter, but Jacob
abode in the tents, and his mother loved him. Once
Esau returned weary from hunting, as Jacob was
making a mess of pottage. And Esau said: Give me
to eat. And Jacob replied: Sell me first thy birthright,
and pledge it to me. And Esau swore, and
sold his birthright, and ate and drank, and went his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
way. Thus Esau despised his birthright; and when he
was forty years old, he took to wife Judith, the daughter
of Beeri the Hittite, and Basmath (Bashemath), the
daughter of Elon the Hittite, and afterwards Mahalath,
the daughter of Ishmael, Nebajoth's sister.</p>

<p>There was a famine in Canaan, and Isaac went to
Gerar in the land of the Philistines, and there dwelt,
and sowed in that land, and received a hundredfold,
for Jehovah blessed him. He became more and more
mighty, and had sheep, and oxen, and many servants.
And Isaac dug out the wells which Abraham's servants
had made, and which the Philistines had filled
up after the death of Abraham. And the shepherds of
Gerar strove with the shepherds of Isaac, and Isaac
called the name of the wells Esek (contention) and
Sitnah (hatred); but to the third, for which the
shepherds of Gerar had not striven, he gave the name
Rehoboth (room). From thence he went to Beersheba,
and there he set up an altar.</p>

<p>When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, he
said to Esau: Take thy bow and quiver, hunt venison
for me, and make a savoury dish such as I love, that
I may eat, and my soul may bless thee before I die.
Esau went forth, but Rebekah, who had heard Isaac's
speech, said to Jacob: Go to the flock and bring me
two kids. I will prepare them for a savoury dish for
thy father, that he may bless thee instead of Esau.
Jacob obeyed, and Rebekah put on him the clothes of
Esau, and placed on his neck and hands the skins of
the kids, that his father, if he touched him, might not
know Jacob by his smooth skin. Then Jacob went in
to his father, and said: I am Esau, thy firstborn; eat
of my venison. How hast thou found it so quickly,
my son? asked the father. Jehovah, thy God, put
it into my hand, he replied. The voice is the voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
of Jacob, the father said, but the hands are the
hands of Esau. He ate, and Jacob brought him wine,
and he drank. Then Isaac said: Come near, and
kiss me, my son. God give thee the dew of heaven,
and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn
and wine. Be thou lord over thy brethren, and let
the sons of thy mother bow before thee. Cursed be
they who curse thee, and blessed be they who bless
thee. And when Jacob had gone away from his
father with this blessing, Esau came with his venison.
Isaac trembled and said: Thy brother has come with
subtilty, and taken away thy blessing. Then Esau
lifted up his voice and wept, and said: My birthright
has he taken from me, and now thy blessing also.
Bless me, even me also, O my father. What can I do
for thee? answered Isaac. Lo! I have made him thy
lord, and all his brethren I have given him for servants,
and I have given him corn and wine. Hast
thou but one blessing? said Esau, and wept. Then
Isaac said: Thy dwelling shall be without the fatness
of the earth and the dew of heaven. By thy sword
thou shalt live; thou shalt serve thy brother, but his
yoke thou shalt break from off thy neck.</p>

<p>Esau was at enmity with Jacob, because he had
deceived him in his father's blessing; and Esau said
in his heart: The days of mourning for my father will
come, for I will slay Jacob. Then Rebekah said
to Jacob: Arise and flee to Laban, my brother, in
Haran, till the anger of thy brother is turned away.
And Rebekah spoke to Isaac, that Jacob should not
take a wife from the daughters of the Hittites; and
Isaac bade Jacob go to Mesopotamia, to the house of
Bethuel, the father of his mother, and there take a
wife from the daughters of Laban. Then Jacob went
from Beersheba to Haran. And when he abode for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
the night at the city of Luz, he put a stone under his
head, and there rested. Then in a dream he saw a
ladder placed upon the earth, the end of which touched
heaven, and the angels of God went up and down
upon the ladder. Jehovah stood over it, and said: I
am the God of Abraham thy father and of Isaac; the
land whereon thou sleepest I will give to thee and thy
seed. And in the morning Jacob arose, and set up
the stone which he had placed under his head for a
sign, and poured oil on the stone, and called the
name of the place Bethel.</p>

<p>In the land of the children of the east Jacob saw
a well, round which lay three flocks of sheep. Then
Jacob said to the shepherds: Whence are ye, my
brethren? They answered, From Haran. Jacob
asked again: Know ye Laban, Nahor's son? And they
said: We know him; it is well with him, and lo!
there is Rachel, his daughter, with the sheep of
her father. And Jacob rolled away the great stone,
which lay at the mouth of the well, and watered
Rachel's sheep; and Laban came, and took his sister's
son into his house. Laban had two daughters: Leah
the eldest had dim eyes, but Rachel was fair to
look upon; and Jacob said to Laban: I will serve
seven years for Rachel. And these seven years were
as seven days in Jacob's eyes, because he loved
Rachel. When the time was past, Laban gathered
together all the people of the place, and made a
feast. But in the dark of the evening he brought
Leah instead of Rachel to Jacob, and it was not till
the morning that Jacob knew Leah. Why hast thou
deceived me? Jacob asked of Laban; have I not
served thee seven years for Rachel? Laban answered,
It is not so done in our country, to give the younger
daughter before the firstborn. Serve me yet seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
years, and thou shalt have Rachel also to wife. So
Jacob abode seven years more with Laban, and
gained Rachel for his second wife, and he kept
Laban's flock for six years more, and the sheep
increased under Jacob's hand.</p>

<p>Leah bore Jacob four sons; Reuben, Simeon, Levi,
and Judah. But Rachel was barren and bore not.
Then Rachel gave her maid Bilhah to Jacob, and
Bilhah bore two sons, Dan and Naphtali. Leah also
gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob, and she bore Gad and
Asher. Then Leah bore Issachar and Zebulon; and
Jehovah heard Rachel, and sent her a son, whom she
called Joseph. When Joseph was born, Jacob said to
Laban: For twenty years I have been with thee; thy
sheep and thy goats have not cast their young, and
the rams of thy flock I have not eaten. Let me
depart that I may go to my own land, with my wives
and children, and give me my hire. What shall I
give thee? asked Laban. Set aside all that are
striped and spotted among thy sheep and goats, and
whatever is afterwards born striped or spotted among
thy sheep and goats, that shall be my hire, said Jacob.
And Laban said: Be it according to thy word. Then
Jacob set apart the coloured sheep and goats; and
when the time of generation came, he took fresh
wands of maple and almond-wood, and made white
strips in them, by peeling off the bark, and cast them
into the wells and runnels, where Laban's sheep and
goats were watered; and everything was born spotted,
and fell to Jacob's share, so that he became mighty,
and gained many sheep and camels, and asses, and
maid-servants, and men-servants. But Laban's countenance
was not towards him as heretofore; and
Laban's sons were angry and said: He has got his
wealth from that which is our father's. Then Jacob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
arose, when Laban was gone to the shearing, and set
forth secretly with his wives and children, and flocks;
and Rachel took the images from the house of her
father, and carried them with her, and Jacob fled over
the river, and set his face towards Mount Gilead.
Then Laban hastened after him, and came up with
him on Mount Gilead, and said: "Why art thou fleeing
secretly before me, so that I cannot accompany thee
with drums, and music, and singing? why hast thou
not allowed me to kiss my daughters, and why hast
thou taken my gods?" Jacob answered: "I was
afraid, for I thought thou wouldest take thy daughters
from me." And Jacob set up a stone on Mount Gilead,
and they made a heap of stones, and offered sacrifice
on the heap, and Laban said: "The God of Abraham
and the God of Nahor be judge between us, and guardian
that thou do not afflict my daughters, or take
other wives to them; and this heap be witness that I
go not after thee for evil, nor shalt thou come beyond
this sign after me for evil." And Jacob swore by him,
whom his father feared, and offered sacrifice on the
mountain. And the heap of stones was called Galeed
(heap of witness), and Mizpah (watch tower), because
Laban had said that Jehovah should be guardian if
they were separated one from the other.</p>

<p>And Jacob sent messengers before him to appease
his brother Esau, to Mount Seir, with 200 ewes, and
20 rams, and 200 she-goats, and 20 he-goats, and 30
camels with their colts, and 40 cows, and 10 bulls,
and 20 she-asses, and 10 asses, as a gift to Esau; and
he divided his flocks into two parts, that the one might
escape, if Esau came against the other; for he was
sore afraid. He rose in the night and took his two
wives, and his two maids, and his eleven children, and
carried them through the ford of the Jabbok, but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
himself remained behind. Then a man wrestled with
him till the morning broke, and smote the socket of
his hip, and Jacob's hip was out of joint. And he
said: "Let me go, for the morning is breaking."
But Jacob said: "I will not let thee go, till thou
blessest me." Then he said: "Thy name shall be
Jacob no longer, but Israel; for thou hast striven with
God, and with men, and hast overcome," and he
blessed him there. And Jacob named the place
Peniel (God's visage), and the sun arose as he passed
beyond Peniel.</p>

<p>Jacob lifted up his eyes, and lo! Esau came, and
with him four hundred men. Then Jacob assigned
his children to Leah and Rachel and the two maids,
and the maids and their children he put in the front,
and next Leah and her children, and last of all Rachel
with her son. He went before them and bowed
himself seven times before his brother. But Esau
embraced him, and kissed him, and they wept. The
present of cattle Esau would not accept. "I have
enough, my brother," he said, "keep what is thine."
But Jacob urged him to take them as a proof that he
had found grace in his eyes. Then Esau took them
and parted in peace from his brother, and on the same
day turned back on his way to Mount Seir. But
Jacob went to Shechem, and bought the field where he
had pitched his tent, and there set up an altar; and
from Shechem he went to Bethel, and there also he built
an altar; and from Bethel Jacob returned to Hebron
to his father Isaac.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the Arabs and Phenicians believed
that the power and might of the gods was present
in certain stones, which they worshipped in their
sanctuaries (pp. <a href="#Page_329">329</a>, <a href="#Page_360">360</a>). The Hebrews also were
acquainted with this worship. The first text tells us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
that God appeared to Jacob when he returned out of
Mesopotamia, that He blessed him, and said: Henceforth
Israel shall be thy name. And God went up from
the place where he had spoken with him, and Jacob
set up a stone as a sign on the place, and poured oil on
it, and called the name of the place Bethel (house of
God).<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> In the older mode of conception, the stone
was itself the house of God. The Ephraimitic text
represents Jacob as resting on the stone when he went
to Mesopotamia, and as seeing in a dream the ladder
on which the angels went up and down;<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> the appearance
of Jehovah at the top of the ladder, as well as
the form of the blessing, belongs to the revision.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
The change of the name Jacob into Israel is referred
by the Ephraimitic text to a definite occasion. To
the Hebrews, in the old time, the god of their tribe
was a jealous and fearful deity, averse to the life of
nature,&mdash;a god who exercised dominion above in the
highest heaven, who rode on the clouds, and announced
himself in thunder and lightning, and earthquakes, who
appeared in flames of fire, whom the eye of mortal man
could not behold and live.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> The supernatural God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
can in the first instance be conceived and regarded
only in contrast to nature, and the life of nature. But
inasmuch as the natural life can only come into being
and continue to exist by his permission, and with his
consent, that life must be redeemed and purchased.
Hence according to the primitive conception of the
Hebrews, everything that was brought to the birth
belonged to their god, the firstlings of the field, and
of beast, the first-born male of the woman. Abraham
was ready to sacrifice the firstborn son of his wife,
the son of his own heart. But he was not permitted
to slay him. He had already offered the sacrifice,
inasmuch as he was resolved to sacrifice what was
dearest, in obedience to the bidding of God. So runs
the Ephraimitic text. As Jacob was returning from
the Euphrates he came upon a place in Gilead, known
as "God's visage." Here, in the dark of the night,
a man wrestled with Jacob till the morning broke,
and Jacob would not let him go till he had blessed
him; "Thou hast striven with God and men, and
overcome; therefore, henceforth thy name shall be
Israel."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> In the myth of the Phenicians, the power
of destruction is taken from the hostile god, when the
friendly god wrestles with him. The Hebrews changed
the wrestling between the hostile and friendly deities,
into a wrestling between the servant and the master,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
between the patriarch of the tribe and his god, a
struggle from which the former does not let the god
go till he has obtained a pledge, that he will spare
him and his tribe, and send increase and blessing to
him and his tribe. The contrast of hostile and friendly
deities, and their struggle with each other, the Hebrew
conceives as the work, the toil, the struggle of men,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> strenuous wrestling to win the blessing of God.
Jacob carried away the injury to his thigh, but he
won the blessing of Jehovah.</p>

<p>With this conception of the Hebrews, that the First-born
belonged to Jehovah, is connected the ordinance
that a ransom must be offered for him. Moreover, in
every spring the Paschal lamb was offered as a sin-offering
for the redemption of the house, along with
the firstlings of the field. The use of circumcision
also, as it seems, stood with the Hebrews in close
connection with the idea that the life of boys must
be ransomed by a bloody sacrifice. Jehovah is said
to have commanded Abraham to circumcise his family
in token of the covenant which he had made with
him and his seed (<a href="#Page_392">p. 392</a>). This custom was also in
use among the Edomites and certain other Arabian
and Syrian tribes.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the genealogy of the Hebrews we had
to assume that the Semitic tribes from Arphaxad first
went to Serug, and afterwards to Ur in Chald&aelig;a;
and that these immigrants, or a branch of them, passed
from Ur to Haran. While the Nahorites remained
behind at Haran, the Abrahamites turned towards
the southern border of Canaan, where the Ammonites
and Moabites, the Ishmaelites and Midianites, separated,
and took possession of the centre of Arabia,
the peninsula of Sinai, and the land eastward of the
Jordan. From the narrative of Isaac, Esau, and
Jacob, it further follows that not only those nations
but also the sons of Esau, the Edomites, were descendants
of Abraham, and the Hebrews were a branch
of the Edomites who had separated from them. Hence
the Hebrews were the youngest scion of the stock
which once came from the mountains of Arphaxad
to Ur, to Mesopotamia, and then into the deserts of
Arabia and Syria. If, however, we allow that the
genealogies of the Hebrews express the position which
they took up or wished to take up towards the kindred
Semitic nations, the Assyrians, Babylonians, Mesopotamians,
the Arabians, Midianites, Moabites, and
Ammonites, and did not attempt to place facts of
history beyond doubt, yet we must not refuse to
recognise a definite historical basis in the relation
of the Hebrews to the Edomites. The Edomites
possessed Mount Seir, which runs from the southern
extremity of the Dead Sea to the north-east corner
of the Red Sea. Before them the Horites possessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
this mountain (<a href="#Page_403">p. 403</a>).<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> According to the Hebrew
tradition the patriarch of the Edomites was Esau.
He "was red in colour and hairy." Though this is
not the meaning of the name Esau, the name Edomites
does actually mean the "red people," and the name
of their mountain Seir means, "to be hairy," a name
which could very well be given to a mountain covered
with briars and brushwood. The Edomites were fond
of the chase and of war; their progenitor is a hunter
and warrior; and to this, his eldest son, Isaac foretells
that his dwelling should be without the fatness of the
earth; by his sword should he live. Only a slight
advantage in age is allowed to Esau: he is merely
the firstborn of twins; and even at birth his brother
Jacob held him by the heel. The pre-eminence which
Isaac gives to the younger son is explained in the
Jud&aelig;an text merely by the fact, that Esau had taken
wives from the Hittites. "And when Esau saw that
Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Mesopotamia
in order to take a wife from thence, Esau saw that the
daughters of Canaan displeased his father, and he
went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter
of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, the sister of Nebajoth,
to wife to his other wives."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> All the further details
of the relations between the two brothers, the sale of
the birthright, the obtaining of the blessing, and the
form of the blessing, belong to the revision. This
text and this only could make Isaac say to Esau,
"Thou shalt serve thy brother, but shalt break his
yoke from off thy neck." Saul conquered, and David
subjugated the Edomites; it was not till the time
of Joram, king of Judah, in the first half of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
ninth century <small>B.C.</small>, that they recovered their independence.</p>

<p>The description of the journey of Jacob to the
Euphrates, his service with Laban, and his flight,
come from the Ephraimitic text: the revision has
only extended the introduction, and here and there
inserted an interpolation. To the same text belongs
the peaceful departure from the Nahorites, the setting
up of a token on the east of Jordan to fix how far the
borders of the Israelites, beyond which the Nahorites
were not to go, were to extend in this direction, and
finally Jacob's reconciliation with Esau. With the
daughters of Canaan whom he took to wife, Esau
could only beget an impure race, and even with the
daughter of Ishmael his race would not be wholly
pure, while Jacob served patiently for fourteen years
in order to obtain wives of the genuine blood. By
this, and by the blessing of Isaac, the pre-eminence
of the younger Israelites is established over the
Edomites; but the brothers parted in peace. Esau
received rich gifts. Thus they separated on the ford
of the Jabbok at the sacred place of Peniel. The one
went to Seir, the other to Shechem in Canaan. Hence
the Edomites had no reason to cherish resentment
against the sons of Jacob.</p>

<p>Isaac and Jacob abode in Canaan at Hebron,
Beersheba, and Shechem. Here Isaac again dug out
the wells which Abraham's servants had previously
made. The quarrel of his servants about the wells
with the Philistines of Gerar is based on the severe
battles afterwards fought between the Philistines and
Israel. As Abraham had set up pillars, so does Isaac
build an altar at Beersheba,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and Jacob sets up a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
sacred stone at Bethel. As Abraham, according to
the first text, buys the burying-place at Hebron, so
Jacob, according to this same text, bought the field
at Shechem, where he had pitched his tent. Thus
Isaac and Jacob also have acquired possessions in
Canaan, and have rendered services to the land;
they also have prepared the way for the rule of their
descendants in Canaan, and have consecrated the
places at which the Hebrews were destined to worship
the gods of their fathers.</p>

<p>The three patriarchs strictly carry out the commands
of Jehovah, from which their descendants swerved
often and long. To the Hebrews they are patterns
of the purity of their race; their descendants did
not always keep themselves free from mixture with
the Canaanites. But they are not only patterns of
the fear of God, and piety, of correct faith and right
dealing with the Canaanites; they also exhibit to the
Hebrews the moral ideal of their conduct. Abraham
is distinguished by the virtues of faithfulness, of unselfishness,
and friendliness to his brother's family,
and, in return, the blessing of Jehovah rests upon
him. Other virtues are brought into prominence by
the tradition in Jacob, the most immediate ancestor
of the Hebrews. If Abraham knew how to raise
the sword, and Esau lived a wild hunter's life, Jacob
is a peaceable, faithful shepherd, who patiently
endures heat and cold, who is ever wide awake,
under whose hand the flocks increase, and whose care
prevents the sheep and goats from casting their young.
When Jacob had served fourteen years for his wives,
he still continued to serve six years for hire. Among
the Hebrews the life of a hired servant is not considered
a degradation; and continuance in service
for the sake of hire is not looked down upon with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
contempt. Jehovah rewards the industrious servant,
the active workman. With his staff in his hand
Jacob passed over the Euphrates; but he returned
rich in flocks and goods, blessed with wife and child.
In his pliancy, his quiet, peaceful trust in God,
his wrestling for the blessing of God, Jacob is the
genuine warrior of God (Israel), who is rescued,
and gains the victory. Beside these stand realistic
traits peculiar to the East and the Hebrew character.
Jacob is a cunning man, who knows how to invent
clever devices. With the help of his mother he
gains from his brother the blessing of the firstborn.
At first Laban outwits him, but in the end Jacob's
cunning is victorious. He knows how to pacify
his brother by subjection. To bow before the mighty
in order to save property and life has not always
appeared dishonourable to the Oriental.</p>

another genealogical table below the series of patriarchs in the

like the first: Adam, Seth, Enos, Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch,

Cain, Enoch, Irad, Mahajael, Methusael, Lamech. To Lamech this narrator
attached the origin of the shepherds, players on instruments, and workers

From the sacrifice of Isaac, the redemption of the firstborn and the
Paschal offering, the conclusion may be drawn that in the oldest times
human sacrifices were not unknown to the Hebrews. If such took place
they were not offered in the same manner as the Moloch-offerings of the
Canaanites. If Jehovah appears in fire, the fire is not, to the Hebrews,
his essence, but only a form or mode of appearance. Sacrifices like those
offered to Moloch were forbidden by the earliest text (Levit. xviii. 22;
xx. 2) under pain of death. The narrative of Jephthah's daughter lays
especial stress on the sanctity of the vow. Of the other passages which
come into consideration only one or two deal with sacrifices; the remainder
have reference to executions. In Numbers xxv. 4, we find, "Take all the
heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun,
that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel."
Jephthah vowed his daughter and sacrificed her, Judges xi. 30, 34. "And
Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal," 1 Samuel xv. 33.
In 2 Samuel xxi. 6-9, the Gibeonites say, "Give us seven men of his
sons that we may hang them before the Lord in Gibeah. And they hanged
them up on the mountain before Jehovah."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT.</h3>


<p>When the progenitors of the Hebrews had come from
the Euphrates to Canaan, and had taken up their
abode there at Hebron and Shechem, when Jacob and
Esau had parted in peace, and the latter had gone
to Mount Seir, Jacob, with all his sons, went to
Egypt.</p>

<p>Jacob dwelt at Hebron&mdash;so runs the narrative&mdash;when
he sent Joseph, the son of Rachel, to his elder brethren
in Shechem, to see if all was well with them and their
flocks. But his brethren hated Joseph, because his
father loved him more than them; and when they
saw him coming, they said: We will slay him. But
the eldest, Reuben, said: Shed no blood, but throw
him into the pit yonder. This they did; they took
from Joseph the coat which his father had made
for him, and thrust him into the pit. Then there
came a caravan of Ishmaelites from Gilead; their
camels carried spices, balsam, and myrrh to Egypt.
And his brethren took Joseph again out of the pit,
and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels
of silver. Then they slew a goat, and dipped the
coat in the blood, and brought it to their father.
Jacob knew the coat, and cried: An evil beast
has eaten my son, and torn his garments; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
would not be comforted, but said: In sorrow will
I go down to the grave to my son. But Joseph
was carried away to Egypt, and was bought by
Potiphar, an Egyptian in the service of the king,
and captain of the body-guard, from the Ishmaelites.
Joseph found grace in the eyes of his master; and
as everything which he undertook prospered, Potiphar
set him over his house. Joseph was goodly to look
upon, and the wife of his master cast her eyes upon
him. But he resisted her, and when she caught him
by his garment, he left his garment in her hand,
and fled out. Then she kept Joseph's garment by
her till Potiphar returned, and said to him: The
Hebrew servant, whom thou has brought to us, came
to me to mock me; and when I lifted up my voice,
he fled away and left his garment. Then Potiphar
was angry, and took Joseph and cast him into the
house of bondage, where were the prisoners of the
king. And it came to pass that the chief butler and
the chief baker sinned against the king, and Pharaoh
put them in prison. Each of these had a dream in
the night, and Joseph interpreted the dreams; and
it came to pass, as he foretold, that the chief baker was
hanged, but the chief butler was restored by Pharaoh
to his office, on his birthday, so that, as before, he
gave the cup into his hand. Two years afterwards,
the king of Egypt saw in a dream seven fat kine
come up out of the Nile, and after them seven lean
kine, and the lean kine ate up the fat. As none of
the interpreters and wise men of Egypt could interpret
this dream, the chief butler bethought him of the
young man of the tribe of the Hebrews, who had
interpreted his own dream in the prison, and told
Pharaoh what had befallen him. Then Pharaoh
sent, and Joseph was quickly brought out of prison,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
and shaved himself, changed his garments, and came
before Pharaoh and said: Seven years of abundance
will come in the land of Egypt, and after them seven
years of famine. Let Pharaoh collect food in the
good years, and gather together corn, and keep it
against the years of famine, that the land be not
destroyed. Then Pharaoh took his ring from his
hand and placed it on the hand of Joseph, and
clothed him in garments of linen, and placed a
golden chain upon his neck, and said: I place thee
over the whole land of Egypt, only by my throne
will I be above thee. And Pharaoh called Joseph
Zaphnath-paaneah, and gave him Asenath, the daughter
of the priest at On, to wife, and caused him to ride
in his second chariot, and the people cried before him:
Bow the knee. When the seven years of abundance
came, Joseph collected food, and gathered up corn
in the cities, without number, as the sand of the
sea. And when the years of famine came, there
was no bread in the land, and the people were compelled
to buy bread from the granaries of Pharaoh;
and when their money failed, they brought their
horses, cattle, sheep, and asses to buy food from
Joseph, and all the cattle in the land came to the
king. And when they had no cattle left to buy
corn, they gave their land and fields. Thus Joseph
bought the land for Pharaoh, and the country became
Pharaoh's, and Joseph said: Here is seed for you;
sow your fields, and at the time of harvest, give the
fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own for
food, for yourselves and your children, and those in
your houses. Thus Joseph laid on the land of the
Egyptians a tax of the fifth, until this day.</p>

<p>The famine was sore in all lands, and in the land
of Canaan, and when Jacob saw that there was corn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
in Egypt, he said to his sons: Go down and buy
for us there, that we die not. Then the brethren of
Joseph went down; but Benjamin, whom Rachel had
borne after Joseph, Jacob sent not with them, for he
feared that some evil might happen to him. Joseph,
who sold corn to the people, knew his brethren when
they bowed themselves to the earth before him, and
remembered how he once dreamed at Hebron that he
was binding sheaves with his brethren in the field,
and his sheaf stood upright, and the sheaves of his
brethren bowed before it; and that the sun, moon,
and eleven stars bowed before him. The interpreter
was between them, and he dealt roughly with his
brethren, and said: Ye are spies, who are come to
see the weakness of the land. No, my lord, they
answered, we are true men, twelve brethren, the sons
of one father in the land of Canaan. The youngest
has remained with our father, and one is not. Then
Joseph took Simeon, and bound him and said: Take
corn for the need of your house, and then bring your
youngest brother with you, that I may see that
ye are not spies; then will I give you back your
brother, and ye shall deal in our land.</p>

<p>When Jacob heard this, he said to his sons: Ye
make me childless; Joseph is no more, and Simeon is
no more, and Benjamin ye would take from me. All
these things are against me. But when the corn was
eaten which they brought out of Egypt, he sent his
sons a second time to buy food; and Benjamin was
with them. Judah had promised his father to be
surety for him. Joseph caused them to be brought
into his house, and gave them water to wash their
feet, and food for their asses, and restored Simeon to
them, and bade them eat at his table. And food was
placed for the brethren by themselves, and for Joseph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
and the Egyptians by themselves. And Joseph caused
presents to be given to them, and Benjamin's present
was the largest; and they were drunken in his house.
Then Joseph caused his steward to fill the sacks of
the strangers with corn, and to replace the purchase
money in each sack, and in Benjamin's sack to place
his own cup of silver. When the morning came, and
the brethren went forth from the city with their sacks
and their asses, Joseph's steward overtook them not
far from the city, and demanded the silver and gold
which they had stolen, and found the cup in Benjamin's
sack. The brethren rent their garments and turned
back, and cast themselves on the earth before Joseph.
But he said: With whomsoever the cup was found he
shall be my servant; the rest may go in peace. Then
Judah came forward and said: When we set forth our
father said, If ye take Benjamin also from me, and
any evil happen to him, ye will bring my grey hairs
with sorrow to the grave. If then we go back to
our father, thy servant, and the boy is not with us,
he will die, for his soul hangs upon him; let me
remain here in his place, and be thy servant, that I
may not see the sorrow of my father. Then Joseph
could no longer restrain himself: he caused the Egyptians
to go out from his presence, and lifted up his voice
with tears, and said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom
ye sold. Hasten, and go to my father, and tell him
of all my glory. Bid him come to me, and you
shall dwell here with your possessions. But Jacob
did not believe the words of his sons, till he saw the
chariots which Pharaoh had sent to carry him to
Egypt. And Jacob set out with his sons, their wives
and their children, seventy souls, with his flocks, and
his goods, to Egypt; and Joseph came to meet him in
his chariot, and wept long on the neck of his father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
and gave to his kindred food, and a dwelling-place in
the land of Goshen. When Jacob's days came to a
close, he called his son Joseph, and said to him: Thy
two sons, born to thee in the land of Egypt, shall be
mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be to me as
Reuben and Simeon. And he laid his right hand on
Ephraim, and named Ephraim the younger before
Manasseh, and said: In thee shall Israel bless and
say: God make thee like Ephraim and Manasseh. And
thus Jacob blessed his other sons also, and to Judah
he said: The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
nor the staff of the ruler from between his feet; he
shall bind his ass to the vine, and the colt of his she-ass
to the choice vine; he shall wash his garment in
wine, and his robe in the blood of the grape; his
eyes are red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
But Joseph is the son of a fruit-tree by a well. The
branches ran over the wall; the archers provoke
and follow him, but his bow remains firm, and the
strength of his hands is supple. So he blessed them,
and said to Joseph: Bury me not in Egypt; bury me
with my fathers in the cave which Abraham bought
of Ephron the Hittite, where Abraham, and Sarah,
and Isaac, and Rebekah are buried, and where I
buried Leah. Then Joseph fell on the face of his
father and wept, and the Egyptians mourned seventy
days for Jacob, and Joseph carried the body with
Pharaoh's servants, and the elders of Pharaoh's house
and of all Egypt, and with all his brethren, and the
whole house of Jacob to Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of Machpelah. But Joseph dwelt in Egypt
till his death, and he saw the sons of Ephraim till the
third generation, and the sons of Machir, the son of
Manasseh, were born on his knees. Joseph died 110
years old, and they embalmed him, and placed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
in a sepulchre in Egypt. And all Joseph's brethren
died. But their sons were fruitful and increased, and
the land was full of them.</p>

<p>Then there arose a new king in Egypt who knew
not Joseph, and he said: The children of Israel are
mighty; we shall be wise to prevent their increase,
that they join not with our enemies if a war arise.
And the Egyptians put taskmasters over the children
of Israel, in order to oppress them with burdens. The
children of Israel were compelled to perform heavy
tasks in the field, and taskwork in clay and bricks;
and they built for Pharaoh the treasure cities of
Pithom and Ramses, and Pharaoh commanded all
his people to throw into the Nile all the male children
born to the Israelites, but to let the daughters live.</p>

<p>It is no longer possible to discover what motives
were given in the Jud&aelig;an text for the settlement of
Jacob and his sons in Egypt. In it the land thus
apportioned to the Hebrews is not called Goshen, but
Ramses. Yet it is clear that even in that account it
was Joseph who procured a habitation and possessions
for his father and brethren in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> The reasons
given for the change in the narrative, as it now stands,
are taken from the Ephraimitic text, which describes
in the most lively manner, the virtues and glory of
the ancestor of this tribe. The prophetic revision
only added a few details, and sharpened a few of
the traits. The second text represented Joseph as
falling into the hands of Midianite merchants, the
revision added Ishmaelites. According to the second
text, Joseph was a servant in the house of Potiphar,
in whose house as captain of the body-guard the
butler and baker of Pharaoh were imprisoned, and
there Joseph interpreted their dreams. The revision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
inserts the temptation of Joseph by Potiphar's wife,
and makes him, owing to her false accusation, a fellow-prisoner
of the butler and baker.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Thus it was able to
exalt Joseph, not from servitude only, but from the
misery of imprisonment to the steps of the throne.</p>

<p>The ethical traits of the narrative, the national and
religious views underlying it, are obvious. The evil
of which his brothers are guilty towards Joseph,
without any offence on his part, he bears with submission.
In the service of the Egyptian he shows
himself a faithful slave; he withstands the most
enticing temptation. In return for this faithful
honesty he is compelled again to suffer innocently.
After long endurance he receives the highest exaltation;
from prison he is summoned to be ruler of the
land, and second only to Pharaoh. As he had been
a faithful steward to Potiphar in small things, he is
now a faithful servant to Pharaoh in great things;
all the events, which he correctly foresaw, he knew
how to turn to the advantage of his master. When
he has shown his brothers, in order to touch their
consciences for the evil they had done to him, how
men may innocently fall into suspicion, punishment,
and misfortune, he generously pardons them. In
this pardon, this rescue of the whole tribe by the man
whom they had attempted to destroy, rests the true
punishment laid upon the brothers. It is the wonderful
guidance of Jehovah which assists the innocent out
of misery and distress, which turns the evil, which the
brothers had committed against Joseph, in such a
direction that in the grievous years of famine the
race of Jacob finds a helper and protector near the
throne of Egypt, who is able to give food and a
habitation to that tribe, and allot to their flocks the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
magnificent pastures of the land of Goshen. The
carrying of the corpse of Jacob to Hebron is intended
to signify that Canaan, and not Egypt, was to be the
lasting abode of the posterity of Jacob. At the same
time the tradition of the Hebrews shows the benefits
which a man of their race conferred upon the Egyptians
in a time of evil; it marks how Egypt, owing
to his foresight, was saved from destruction, in order
at the same time to show how little the Egyptians
regarded these benefits, and how great is the contrast
presented by their subsequent conduct towards the
Hebrews.</p>

<p>The description of Egypt corresponds exactly to
the circumstances of the land as we have found them
before. Both the author of the Ephraimitic text and
the reviser were well acquainted with the life and
customs of Egypt. We have found captains of the
body guard in the retinue of Pharaoh (<a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>), a
chief baker is also to be seen on the monuments, and
although we cannot point to any butler of the king
upon them, we know that in Egypt wine was not
wanting at the table of Pharaoh, any more than
among his workmen.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> In the whole of the East, and
demonstrably in Egypt, great importance was attached
to dreams.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> By knowing how to explain their
meaning more correctly than the wise men and interpreters
of Egypt&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> than the prophets, and temple-scribes
of the Egyptian priesthood<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>&mdash;Joseph is
liberated from prison, and raised to the position of
grand vizier. The robes of byssus, in which Joseph
is now clad, we have found to be the prescribed dress
of the priests (<a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>), and if Pharaoh puts a golden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
chain round his neck, we have already met with an
instance of this kind of distinction (<a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>). That
the Pharaohs regarded themselves as proprietors of
the soil, that they collected a land-tax, and that the
fields would require to be measured in order to collect
this tax, has been already stated (<a href="#Page_194">p. 194</a>). This
tax, so surprising to them, the Hebrews explained by
assuming that the Egyptians sold their plots to
Joseph in the time of the famine, which were then
given back to the proprietors in return for a fifth of
the yearly produce. Hereby the services of Joseph to
the throne are placed in the clearest light. We saw
above that it was the first object of Pharaoh and his
ministers to provide Egypt with life and sustenance
(pp. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>, <a href="#Page_184">184</a>). Joseph's wisdom and providence
put Pharaoh in a position to attain this object, even in
the years of the famine. The names also quoted in
the Hebrew narrative seem to correspond to the
ancient Egyptian. The name Potiphar may be explained
by Petphra, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "dedicated to Ra," or by
Puti-phra, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "given by Ra." The name of the
daughter of the priest at On (Heliopolis), Asenath,
whom Joseph took to wife, can be explained by
As-neith, and the Egyptian name of Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah,
by Zpentpouch, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "creator of life" (in
the time of famine).<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Setting aside these points in the narrative, what
historical value can be given to the tradition that the
children of Jacob went from the south of Canaan to
the east of Egypt, that they remained there 430 years,
according to the older text, and in this period
increased into a mighty people?<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The district given
to the children of Jacob for their abode lies, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
tradition plainly shows, in the lower country east of
the Nile, beyond the Eastern or Tanitic mouth. The
name Goshen, given in the Ephraimitic text, appears
to correspond to Keshem, the name of a province in
Lower Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> The chain of mountains running on
the east of the Nile, sinks down between the Tanitic
arm and the north-west corner of the Arabian Gulf,
and on the slopes nearer the river presents a flat
extent of pasture land. In Egypt a tribe of shepherds
could have no share in the regular system of
cultivation, and the fixed order of Egyptian life;
a district suitable for the maintenance of their flocks
would be allotted to them, and nothing more. On the
north of this district, the nearest of the great cities of
Egypt was Tanis (Zoan), on the south, Heliopolis (On,
Anu), with which we have become acquainted as a
great centre of religion, and the seat of the worship
of the sun god Ra, and the god of life Bennu-Osiris
(pp. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>). Hence with perfect consistency, the
Hebrew tradition narrates that the daughter of a
priest of Heliopolis was given to Joseph to wife.</p>

<p>But what could induce the children of Jacob to go
to Egypt, or the Egyptians to give them a pasture-land
on their north-eastern border? We arrived
above at the conclusion that the tribe of Jacob was a
branch of the Edomites, whose dwelling-place is fixed
by tradition in the mountains between the north-east
point of the Arabian Gulf and the Dead Sea,
where in fact we find them in historical times. This
tribe, therefore, both at the time when in union with
the Edomites it passed along the eastern and southern
borders of Canaan, and after separating from the
Edomites&mdash;who may have already taken Mount Seir
from the Horites, or have pastured their flocks in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
vicinity&mdash;was at no great distance from Egypt. When
divided from the Edomites, the fear of the stronger
part of the tribe from which they had separated, and
the desire to find more fruitful pastures in the neighbourhood
of the Nile, or want of corn, as the tradition
says, might have induced the sons of Jacob to leave
the borders of Canaan for the borders of Egypt. The
tribes, or families of shepherds, who pastured their
flocks in the neighbourhood of Canaan, may have
been accustomed to purchase corn when their own
cultivation was insufficient, from the corn-growers in
Canaan. A blight in Canaan would therefore compel
them to turn to the abundance of corn in Egypt. And
to a shepherd tribe, which sought her protection, and
submitted voluntarily to her rule, Egypt would be the
more inclined to give up the pastures beyond the
Nile, if this tribe was in unfriendly or hostile relations
to the Semitic tribes in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>If we attempt to fix the date at which the tribe of
Jacob may have exchanged the pastures on the border
of Canaan for the more fruitful regions on the Tanitic
arm of the Nile, it soon becomes clear that the
accounts of the Hebrews cannot be maintained. The
older text puts 215 years between the time when
Abraham entered Canaan and the arrival of the sons
of Jacob into Egypt, and exactly twice this amount
between their arrival in and exodus from Egypt. The
fixed proportion between the two numbers, and the
further circumstance that tradition can only mention
a few generations of the sons of Jacob,<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> leads to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
conclusion that those numbers do not spring from any
record or actual remembrance, but have been invented
upon reflection. The date of the exodus also is fixed
by a round sum; from the exodus to the building of
the temple 480 years are said to have elapsed.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> The
Hebrews reckoned 40 years to the generation; hence
they put twelve generations between the exodus and
the building of the temple, and fixed the interval on
this computation; yet their scriptures could only
mention by name nine or ten generations in this
period.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Hence the dates 2140 <small>B.C.</small>, and 1925 <small>B.C.</small>,
which are deduced from the older text for the entrance
of Abraham into Canaan, and of Jacob into Egypt, if
the beginning of the building of the temple is fixed
according to traditional assumption in the year 1015
<small>B.C.</small>, must be given up, as well as the year 2115 <small>B.C.</small>
for the entrance of Abraham into Canaan, and the
year 1900 <small>B.C.</small> for the settlement of Jacob in Egypt,
which results from the fixing the beginning of the
building of the temple in the year 990 <small>B.C.</small> The
only fact in the ancient tradition which admits of an
approximate date is the campaign of Kudur-Lagamer
of Elam, mentioned in the Ephraimitic text. This
campaign we ventured to place about the year 2000
<small>B.C.</small> Genesis represents him as defeating the nations
on the east and south of Canaan, and the Horites on
Mount Seir, while at the separation of Esau and Jacob
Mount Seir is no longer the abode of the Horites, but
of the tribe of Esau. But we must contest the claim
of tradition to bring the history of Abraham into
connection with this campaign of the Elamites to the
west. On the other hand we may regard it as settled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
that the tribe of Jacob did not arrive in Egypt at the
time when the valley of the Nile was under the dominion
of the Hyksos, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the period from 2101 <small>B.C.</small>
to 1591 <small>B.C.</small>, which we have assumed for this dominion,
and that during this time it did not dwell in Egypt.
The tradition of the Hebrews was not likely to forget
that their ancestors came to the Nile, not as fugitives,
but as kinsmen of the ruler of Egypt, or that their
race had once shared in the rule over Egypt, and thus
they might have dropped the slavery and imprisonment,
and the position of Joseph in Pharaoh's service.
And if these grounds are not held to be sufficient&mdash;if
the tribe of Jacob was in Egypt under the dominion
of the Hyksos, it must have been involved in their
overthrow and expulsion.</p>

<p>Thus it may be assumed as proved that the admission
of the sons of Jacob into Egypt did not take place
till after the complete expulsion of the Hyksos, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> till
Tuthmosis III. had forced the shepherds to leave the
region to which they were at last confined, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> till after
the year 1591 <small>B.C.</small> And it can hardly have taken
place immediately after this event. We cannot suppose
any inclination among the Egyptians, immediately
after the expulsion of foreign shepherd tribes, to admit
shepherds of the same nationality to the Nile. But
when Tuthmosis III. had carried his weapons as far as
the Euphrates, and received yearly tribute from the
Syrians, the Cheta, and the Retennu, there would be
no scruples felt about allotting pastures on the edge
of the desert to an inconsiderable shepherd tribe.
Hence the settlement of the sons of Jacob in Goshen
may be placed about the middle of the sixteenth
century <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The tradition of the Hebrews informed us that their
ancestors were compelled to build the two treasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>-cities
Pithom and Ramses for Pharaoh. This statement
is in the Ephraimitic text, while the Jud&aelig;an text
calls the land given to the Hebrews Ramses.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> The
ruins of Pithom and of Ramses we found on the
canal which Sethos I. and Ramses II. intended to carry
from the Nile at Bubastis into the Arabian Gulf, and
which was completed as far as the Lake of Crocodiles
(<a href="#Page_157">p. 157</a>). The depression of the Wadi Tumilat, which
the canal followed, crosses the land of Goshen. Cities
could not be founded here till the canal from the Nile
had provided water in sufficient quantity. A city of
the name of Pa-Rameses, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> abode of Ramses, could
only be founded by a prince of that name. Being
situated on the canal of Ramses II. and further to the
east than Pithom, the city could only have been built
by the prince whose reign we have placed from 1388
<small>B.C.</small> to 1322 <small>B.C.</small> As a fact his image is found here on
a block of granite in the ruins between the gods Ra
and Tum, and the bricks in the remains of the outer
walls are mixed with cut straw, the use of which in
moulding the bricks for these buildings is mentioned
by the revision.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> This city of Ramses must have been
of considerable importance for the district allotted to
the Hebrews, as the whole region was called after it.
Hence the sons of Jacob were in the land of Goshen in
the reign of Ramses II. The tradition allows them
to remain unmolested in Egypt for a long time&mdash;"not
till the land was full of them," so runs the older
text, without ascribing any other motive, "did the
Egyptians force the children of Israel to work in clay
and brick, and in the fields."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> In the former class of
works comes the building of these two cities. Hence
the Israelites must have reached Goshen before the
time of Ramses II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>The desired evidence of the presence of the children
of Jacob in Egypt could be obtained from Egyptian
writings and monuments if it were certain that a name
used in them referred to the Hebrews. On a hieratic
papyrus (now at Leyden) an officer intreats his
superiors to give him corn "for the soldiers and the
Apuriuu who drag stones to the great fortress of the
house of Ramses, beloved of Ammon," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> king Ramses
II.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> In other places in the same papyrus the name
occurs as Apruu. Another papyrus observes under date
of Ramses III. (<a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>)&mdash;"2083 Apruu at this place"
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> at Heliopolis.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> In an inscription in the quarries
at Hamamat it is said that 800 Apuriu or Apriu are
mentioned as workmen.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> But is the Egyptian name
of the Hebrews really Apru or Apuriu? The wife of
Potiphar, it is true, calls Joseph "the Hebrew servant"
(<a href="#Page_421">p. 421</a>); but did the sons of Jacob really bear
the name of Hebrews&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> men of the other side&mdash;when
they came to Egypt? Does not the meaning of
the name in the places quoted seem rather to be of a
general kind, than to denote any one particular stock?</p>

<p>The kings Sethos I. and Ramses II. (1439-1322 <small>B.C.</small>)
were engaged in battle, as we have seen, with the
Schasu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the shepherd tribes between Egypt and
Canaan, with the Hittites, who possessed the south
of Canaan, and other tribes of Syria (<a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>). Even
though they obtained successes over these nations,
and Sethos I. once forced his way to the Euphrates,
and Ramses II. as far as the coasts of the Phenicians,
yet the Schasu, like the Cheta, continued to be
dangerous enemies of Egypt. If this were not so,
why should Sethos have hit upon the plan of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
protecting the eastern frontier from Pelusium to
Heliopolis, by a vast fortification? What induced
Ramses, after several campaigns in Syria, to conclude
a peace with the Cheta in the year 1367 <i><small>B.C.</small></i> (<a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a>),
in which the advantage was not with Egypt? Ramses
III. had again to fight with the Schasu, the Hittites,
the Amorites, and the Philistines (<a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>). But if
Egypt had to take measures to keep off the shepherds
and the Syrians, they would hardly suffer doubtful
subjects of the same nation within their own borders;
in the peace just mentioned it was expressly stipulated
that neither party should receive the subjects coming
to him from the other side (<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>). Under such
circumstances it was necessary to take measures that
the Hebrews should "not join with the enemies," as
the second text says.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> The attempt had to be made
to settle and assimilate them, and make them
Egyptians. The fortifications from Pelusium to
Heliopolis included just the region allotted to the
Hebrews. These works required hands to build
them. There was also the project of the canal from
the Nile to the Arabian Gulf. As the fortification
surrounded Goshen, so the canal ran athwart it,
from Bubastis to the Lake of Crocodiles. If this
canal, as well as the fortifications, required a great
number of hands&mdash;and naturally those who were
nearest would be first employed&mdash;the water brought
by the canal made it possible to change the pastures
along the canal into arable land, and to build cities
upon it. From all this it is not improbable that the
oppression of which the Hebrews speak commenced
under the reign of Sethos I. continued under Ramses
II, and was increased by the building of those two
cities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>The tradition of the Hebrews maintains that the
Hebrew nation arose in Egypt; in that country the
family became a nation. The Egyptians could endure
a tribe of shepherds on their borders, but not a
powerful nation. With seventy souls, according to
the first text, Jacob came into Egypt, and at the end
of their sojourn the Hebrews, according to the same
authority, had increased to 600,000 men, besides
women and children.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Supposing the seventy to be
a sacred number, and reckoning into the total "a
number of strangers," who according to the revision
joined the Hebrews, it is still quite impossible, even if
the tribe which, as we assume, exchanged the pastures
of the south of Canaan for those on the Nile about
the middle of the sixteenth century numbered its
thousands at the time of the change, that they should
have increased to 600,000 full-grown men, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to more
than two millions of souls, within the given period of
something less than the 250 years, to which the length
of their settlement on the Nile will be shown to be
limited. Even if we assume that the strangers
made up a third of the whole total, this is impossible.
At a much later time the number of the fighting
men among the Hebrews can scarcely be reckoned
higher than from two to three hundred thousand.
Even if we regard the total as including the whole
population, and not confined to the fighting men, it
still appears very high. Granting, too, that an
enumeration was not in itself impossible (the Hebrews
had long had before them the pattern of the enumerations
in Egypt), yet a closer examination shows, that
the total is founded upon an average of 50,000 souls
for each of the twelve tribes. This total therefore must
be given up as a mere attempt to glorify the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
times.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> The events which follow show that the
Israelites did really increase from a tribe to a nation
under the protection of Egypt, and could put in
the field from fifty to sixty thousand warriors,&mdash;a
growth and increase which in their old pastures, the
proximity of the far more powerful Edomites, Hittites,
Midianites, and Amalekites, could hardly have allowed
sufficient space.</p>

<p>The twelve tribes, into which the nation of the
Hebrews was divided, were carried back to the sons
of Jacob, who were thought to be their ancestors.
This fact has obviously influenced the number and
position of these sons in the tradition. The tribes
which claimed to be the oldest must have sprung
from the oldest sons of Jacob; those who boasted of
the purest descent must have for their progenitors
sons born in lawful marriage; those whose blood was
less pure were derived from sons born to Jacob by the
handmaids of his wives. We found above (<a href="#Page_409">p. 409</a>)
that Leah, sprung from the true blood of the fathers,
while yet in Haran, had borne Reuben, Simeon,
Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon. The oldest
families of the Hebrews were named after Reuben.
These, "the sons of Reuben," were "brave men who
carried the sword and the shield, and drew the bow,
and were skilful in war;"<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> but even in later times
they still pursued the old pastoral mode of life in the
mountain glades on the east of Jordan, and hence
had no important influence on the development of the
nation. This remarkable insignificance of the oldest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
tribe is accounted for in the revision by a sin of the
ancestor, who lay with Bilhah, his father's handmaid.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
According to the same prophetic authority, Simeon
and Levi also had done an unclean deed, and Judah
had once been equally guilty.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> It is for his account
of Judah only that we must make this narrator
entirely responsible. For the deeds of Reuben,
Simeon, and Levi, he has merely developed hints
contained in the "Blessings of Jacob," a poem of the
time of the Judges, which he found existing in the
Ephraimitic text.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> That poem says expressly that
Reuben, though the firstborn, was not to have the
pre-eminence; and Simeon and Levi, "because in
their anger they slew a man, and in their passion
lamed a bull," were to be scattered in Israel, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
were to have no district specially their own. In
contrast to the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi,
this poem celebrated the tribe of Joseph&mdash;under
which name the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh
were included&mdash;whose praise has been already given,
and it brings into prominence the tribe of Judah.
The strength of the nation rested on the tribes of
Ephraim and Judah; they had done the best service
at the conquest of Canaan, and were the foremost in
defending the land. The tribe of Ephraim was first
in battle, and it retained this superiority for centuries.
The tribe was not sprung from the oldest, but
from the most beloved son of Jacob, the late-born son
of Rachel. Ephraim was the younger of the two sons
born to Joseph by the Egyptian woman, but Jacob
had placed his right hand on the head of the younger

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE LIBERATION OF THE HEBREWS.</h3>


<p>The oppression which, according to the Pentateuch,
the Egyptians exercised upon the sons of Jacob when
settled in the land of Goshen, by field-labour and
tasks of building, may be regarded as a historical
fact. It is proved by the position of Egypt and her
relations to her neighbours on the north-east in the
fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small>, and it agrees with the arrangements
and aims entertained and carried out in
this border-land by Sethos I. and Ramses II. It
must have been a grievous burden for the Hebrews
to pass from the easy life of shepherds to the work of
agriculture, and abandon the old life with their flocks.
In addition there were the heavy tasks of the fortifications,
the canal, and the new cities. Were they to
give up the memory of their fathers, and their attachment
to their customary mode of life, in order to
perform taskwork for the Egyptians and become
Egyptians? Was it possible to escape this grievous
oppression? How could they be freed from the
mighty power of the Pharaohs? Could the Hebrews,
a peaceful nation and without practice in war, venture
to resist the numerous, disciplined, and drilled
armies of Egypt?</p>

<p>The Hebrew tradition gives the following account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
of the liberation of their forefathers, connecting it
with the supposed command of Pharaoh to throw into
the Nile all the male children born to the Israelites,
and to allow the daughters only to live. The son of
Levi, the son of Jacob, was Kahath, and Kahath's
son was Amram. Amram had a son born to him by
his wife Jochebed. When Jochebed saw that the boy
was fair, she hid him for three months; and when she
could hide him no longer, she took an ark of reeds and
daubed it with resin and pitch, and placed the boy in
it, and put the ark in the reeds on the bank of the
Nile, and the boy's sister was placed near to see what
would come to pass. Then Pharaoh's daughter came
with her maidens to bathe in the river. She saw the
ark, and caused it to be brought to her, and when she
opened it the boy wept. It is one of the children of
the Hebrews, she said, and had pity on it. Then the
sister came and offered to find a nursing-woman from
among the Hebrews, and brought her mother. When
the child grew up, Pharaoh's daughter took him for
her son, and called him Moses. One day Moses went
out to his brethren and saw their burdens, and when
an Egyptian smote a Hebrew, and Moses perceived
that no one was at hand, he slew the Egyptian, and
fled before Pharaoh into the land of Midian. And as
he rested at a well, the seven daughters of Jethro came
to water the sheep of their father, but the other shepherd
prevented them, and drove them away. Then
Moses came to their help, and watered their sheep,
and their father Jethro took him in, and Moses found
favour in his eyes, and took Zipporah, one of his
daughters, to wife, and kept Jethro's sheep. After
many days the king of Egypt died, and the sons of
Israel sighed by reason of their burdens; and God
heard their complaint, and thought of his covenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then Moses, as
he was keeping the flocks of Jethro, and led them
behind the desert, and came to Mount Horeb, saw a
bush burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed.
And Moses approached, and Jehovah spoke
to him out of the bush, and said: I am the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; come not near; put
thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place where thou
standest is holy ground. Then Moses veiled his face,
for he was afraid to look upon God. Then Jehovah
said: I have seen the misery of my people in Egypt,
and I will deliver them. Thou shalt go to Pharaoh
and lead my people away to Canaan, to a land flowing
with milk and honey. Moses answered: O my Lord,
I am not a man of words; I cannot speak to the
children of Israel, for I am dull of speech and heavy
of tongue. Go, said Jehovah, I will be with thy lips,
and will teach thee what to say; and Aaron thy
brother, the priest, can speak. Then Moses took his
wife and his sons and put them upon the ass, and
turned back to Egypt, and Aaron his elder brother
met him in the desert. Moses told him the commands
of Jehovah, and they gathered the elders of
Israel together, and the people believed their words.</p>

<p>Then Moses and Aaron came into the presence of
the king of Egypt, and said: Let us go with our
people three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice
to our God Jehovah, that He may not visit us with the
pestilence or the sword. The king answered: Would
ye free the people from their tasks? Go to your
work. And he ordered the taskmasters and the overseers
to increase the work of the Israelites, and make
their service heavier, and to give them no more straw
for their bricks, so that they might be compelled to
gather straw for themselves. But the daily tale of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
bricks remained the same, and the chiefs of the
Israelites were beaten because they could not make
up the sum. Then Moses and Aaron went again to
Pharaoh, and Aaron threw down his rod before the king,
and lo! it became a serpent. Then the wise men and
magicians of Egypt cast their rods down, and they also
became serpents, but Aaron's serpent consumed the
rest. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters
of Egypt, and the water in the stream was turned
into blood, and the fish died, and the water became
foul and noisome. But the magicians of Egypt did
the same by their art. Then Aaron stretched out his
hand over the stream, and the frogs came up over the
fields, into the houses, the chambers, the beds, the
ovens and kneading-troughs. Then Pharaoh called
Moses and Aaron to take away the frogs from
him and his land; he was willing to let them go.
And the frogs died away out of the houses, the courts,
and the fields. But when Pharaoh was delivered he
hardened his heart, and would not let the Hebrews
go. Then Aaron turned the dust of the earth into
flies, and Moses and Aaron took at Jehovah's bidding
ashes of the oven and sprinkled them in the air,
and the dust of the ashes became boils and blains,
breaking out on man and beast, on the magicians,
and all the Egyptians. And Moses stretched out his
hand to heaven, and Jehovah caused it to thunder
and hail, and fire came down, and the hail smote
all that was in the field, man and beast, and all the
herbs of the field; and all the trees were destroyed;
only in the land of Goshen there was no hail. And
Moses stretched out his hand over all Egypt, and
Jehovah brought the east wind, and in the morning
the east wind brought swarms of locusts, and they ate
up all that the hail had left in the field: there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
nothing green in the field and in the trees. And
Moses stretched his hand towards heaven, and there
was a thick darkness in the land of Egypt for three
days. And now the king was willing to let Israel
go, but their flocks and herds must remain behind.
Moses answered that not a single hoof should remain,
and went in wrath from the presence of Pharaoh.
But to the Israelites he said: At midnight Jehovah
will go forth and smite all the firstborn of Egypt,
from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the
woman behind the mill, and all the firstborn of cattle.
But they were to slay a yearling lamb without blemish
for each household, and to eat it roast, with unleavened
bread and bitter herbs. With loins girded, with shoes
on their feet, and staff in hand, they were to keep the
feast. With the blood of the lamb they were to strike
the door-posts and the lintel of their houses, that
Jehovah might see the blood and pass by their doors.
In the morning there was not a house of the Egyptians
in which there was not one dead. There was a
great cry in Egypt, and the king called Moses and
Aaron and said: Depart with your people, your flocks,
and your herds.</p>

<p>Then the children of Israel set forth from Ramses
to Succoth&mdash;600,000 men on foot, besides children.
And with them went a number of strangers, and many
flocks and herds. And they went from Succoth, and
encamped at Etham, on the edge of the desert; and
from Etham they went to Pihahiroth, and encamped
over against Baalzephon. But Pharaoh was grieved
that he had let the people go from their service; he
pursued them with all his chariots, his horsemen, and
his army, and found them encamped on the sea at
Pihahiroth, over against Baalzephon. But Moses
stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind
through the whole night, and made the sea into dry
land, and the Israelites passed through the midst of
the sea, and the waters were a wall upon their right
hand and a wall upon their left. And the Egyptians
pursued and came after them with their chariots and
their horsemen into the sea. Then Moses again
stretched out his hand, and the sea returned towards
morning into its bed, and covered the chariots and
the horsemen of Pharaoh, so that not one of them
was left.</p>

<p>And Moses and the children of Israel sang: I will
sing of Jehovah, for he is glorious; the horses and
chariots he whelms in the sea; Jehovah, the God of
my father, will I praise. Jehovah is a man of war;
Thy right hand, O Jehovah, shatters the enemy. The
chariots of Pharaoh and his might he threw into the
sea; his chosen charioteers were drowned in the reed-sea.
The floods covered them; like stones they sank
in the pit. At the breath of Thy nostrils the waters
rose in a heap; the floods stood like a bank; the
floods ran in the midst of the sea. The enemy said:
I will pursue, and overtake, and divide the spoil; I
will satisfy my lust upon them; I will draw my sword,
and destroy them with my hand. Thou didst blow
with Thy mouth, O Jehovah, and the sea covered
them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Who among the gods is like unto thee, Jehovah?<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>The older text narrated in a simple manner, that the
Hebrews multiplied greatly in Egypt, and the Egyptians
vexed them with heavy burdens, and God heard their
cry, and thought of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. Then God spoke to Moses: he would
take Israel for his people, and lead them out of Egypt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
and Moses spoke to the children of Israel, but they did
not listen to him. Then the command came to Moses
to speak to Pharaoh, and Aaron was to speak for him.
Afterwards came the plagues (to which the revision has
added the hail, the locusts, and the darkness),<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> the
slaying of the firstborn, the march through the sea as
described.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> The text of the tribes of Joseph is far
better instructed, or, at any rate, far more detailed in
its account of Moses, no less than in that of Joseph.
To it belongs the command of Pharaoh to slay the
children of the Hebrews, the rescue of Moses, the
history of his youth, his flight into the desert, his
connection with Jethro, the appearance of God on
Sinai, and certain traits in the dealings with Pharaoh,
and the direct action of God in the march through
the sea and the desert.</p>

<p>Of both these narratives the tendency is the same,
it is only more strongly marked and broadly realised
in the second. The God of the Hebrews has pity on
the sufferings of his people. He provides and arouses
their leader. To him and to Aaron he imparts the
power of working miracles which the magicians of
Egypt can only imitate up to a certain point. Yet
the power of working miracles given to Moses and
Aaron is not enough to overcome Pharaoh. The
decisive stroke is given by Jehovah himself, inasmuch
as he smites the firstborn among the Egyptians of
man and beast. And when Pharaoh hastens after the
Hebrews Jehovah causes the sea to retire before them,
and finally buries Pharaoh and his host under the
returning waves. Thus has Jehovah led his people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched
arm.</p>

<p>The narrative of the slaying of the firstborn of the
Egyptians and the mode in which the Hebrews protected
themselves from the visitation are borrowed from
the Hebrew ritual. We saw above that the firstlings
of the fruits, and "all that first opens the womb, man
or beast," belonged to the God of the Hebrews.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> This
firstborn must be sacrificed, or ransomed by a vicarious
sacrifice. In the spring the sacrifice of the firstfruits
was offered from an ancient period, and unleavened
bread eaten, as was usual with shepherds.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> The
spring, the time when nature has borne anew, was also
the right time to offer the sacrifice for the redemption
of the house. The head of the family at the spring
festival slew a lamb without breaking any bone, and
with the blood he smeared the lintel and door-posts.
Hence the offering in the spring was also the festival
of redemption and purification&mdash;the passover, the
<i>passah</i> of Jehovah, who had spared the house for the
lamb. To this old spring sacrifice, which was
celebrated in the month Nisan, the first month of the
Hebrew year (it was the year of the Babylonians), at
the time of the full moon, when the sun was in the
Ram, the first text has already attached a historical
background and meaning. It was in the night following
this sacrifice that the exodus from Egypt took
place. The unleavened bread of the ancient custom
was explained by the haste of the exodus; and as
signs of the readiness to go forth, the girdle round the
loins, the shoes upon the feet, and the staff in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
hand were added to the old ritual; the smearing of
the lintel with the blood was done in order that the
angel of Jehovah might distinguish the doors of the
Israelites from those of the Egyptians. Tradition
turned the spring festival and sacrifice into a feast of
thanksgiving for the protection of the firstborn of the
Israelites while Jehovah carried off those of the
Egyptians, a thanksgiving for the deliverance of the
nation out of Egypt.</p>

<p>The lofty calling of the man whom Jehovah
summoned to be the instrument of the deliverance
is shown in the Ephraimitic text by the marvellous
fortune which attended him even in his earliest years.
The daughter of Pharaoh himself, disregarding her
father's commands, rescues the boy, brings him up,
takes him for her son, and gives the name to the man
who is destined to liberate the Hebrews and bring so
much misfortune upon Egypt. Amid the kindness
shown to him by the Egyptians Moses does not forget
the people to whom he belongs. The sight of the
oppressions which his people suffer kindles his heart.
A rash action, by which he avenges the ill-treatment
of a Hebrew, compels him to fly into the desert. Here
he founds a family by taking a Midianitish woman,
a daughter of the desert, to wife. In the second text
the father of his wife is called Jethro, in the revision
Reuel.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> When he has begotten sons here, and is
advanced in years, his mission is revealed to him on
the mountain of God. In both texts he hesitates to
undertake it, but finally carries it resolutely to the end.</p>

<p>As in the narrative of Joseph, so here, all that is
said of Egypt agrees with what we know from other
sources of that country. As the Hebrews were settled
to the east of the Tanitic arm of the Nile, the locality of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
the exposure in the meaning of the Ephraimitic text
must be sought in the neighbourhood of Tanis. We saw
above that Ramses II. erected considerable buildings
in this district (<a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>). The name Moses, which the
king's daughter is said to have given to the rescued
boy, may be connected without violence with the
Egyptian messu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the child. The plagues too which
tradition represents as coming upon Egypt are suited
to the nature of the land. Even now the water of the
Nile becomes at times red and disagreeable in smell;
often after the inundation swarms of frogs cover the
fields, and at the same time myriads of marsh-gnats
and flies rise out of the mud, and locusts from time
to time in thick devastating swarms cover the fields
in the valley of the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Eruptions of the skin also
occur after the inundation, and sometimes grow into
large boils. Storms of hail, though not entirely
unknown, are yet extremely rare in Egypt, and storms
from the south-west, which in the spring blow over
the great desert, are one of the worst plagues in
Egypt; they bring with them violent heat and thick
dust, which darkens the sky.</p>

<p>If we attempt to ascertain the historical value of
these narratives, it follows from the helpless position
of the Hebrews in regard to the Egyptians which we
have already described, that the idea of rescuing them
from the dominion of Egypt could only have been
entertained by a resolute spirit, and the undertaking
begun by a leader who was prepared to make the
highest venture in order to preserve the highest
prize&mdash;nationality and religion. Among the Hebrews
there could be no other thought but to leave the
borders of Egypt in order to resume the old mode of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
life in the deserts of Syria, and there to worship their
old God in the old manner. In harmony with the
situation the Ephraimitic text represents the resolution
to make an exodus as growing up after long hesitation
and grave thought in the soul of a man who, owing to
the oppression of his people, had come into the sharpest
conflict with Egypt, had fled into the desert in order
to save his life, and there had again seen and lived
the free life of the kindred tribes. If the Hebrews
intended to leave Egypt it was necessary to know
certainly that the tribes of the desert, or at least a
part, would receive them, and that they would not
one and all oppose them. By combination with the
Midianites the conditions most needed for the exodus
could be supplied. If of the Midianites and the
Amalekites, the desert tribes who dwelt nearest to
Egypt, the first were gained for the Hebrews, and from
them support, assistance, and alliance in repulsing
an Egyptian attack might be expected, then it was
possible to hope for success in the venture. The
Ephraimitic text represents the Hebrews as choosing
that moment for carrying out the exodus in which
there was a change of the succession in Egypt, and it
is obvious that a change of this kind, the commencement
of a new and perhaps contested dominion, secured
better prospects for the Hebrews than an established
rule when obedience was unchallenged.</p>

<p>According to the older text the Israelites gathered
together near the city of Ramses (Abu Kesheb) for
the exodus. We have seen that this city was built on
the canal, nearly in the middle of the district allotted
to the Hebrews; it was therefore the natural place for
meeting. From this the Israelites took a southern
direction towards the north-west point of the Arabian
Gulf, which is known to the Hebrews as the reed-sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
This was the shortest way of reaching the deserts
of the peninsula of Sinai and the pastures of the
Midianites, and on this line the Hebrews had the
Bitter Lakes at hand, from which could be obtained
what water was absolutely necessary. When they had
passed Succoth, Etham, Pihahiroth, and had reached
the corner of the reed-sea, as the first text describes,
the pursuit overtook them, which Pharaoh had begun
with a hastily-collected force. Southward of the
extreme point of the reed-sea, in the neighbourhood of
Suez, there are firths which can be crossed at the ebb,
especially if a strong north-east wind drives back the
waves to the south-west. By a strong east wind, blowing
through the whole night, Jehovah caused the sea
to retire, and turned it into dry land; and the water
became a wall on the right hand and the left, as we
learnt from the oldest account. The extreme point of
the reed-sea, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the sea on the left of the firth, is
too deep to be crossed, on the right the wind and the
ebb kept the waters back.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Thus it was not in itself
impossible that the Hebrews reached the other shore,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the peninsula of Sinai, by passing through the
firth and cutting off the extreme point of the sea; and
not impossible that the Egyptian army in their eagerness
to overtake the Hebrews, or afraid that the marshes at
the head of the sea would detain them so long that
they could not come up with them before the desert
made pursuit very difficult, attempted to cross the sea
when the water had already returned. The narrative
is supported to some extent by the ancient song of
victory (<a href="#Page_446">p. 446</a>). This song, it is true, cannot be
proved to belong to that period, but it is nevertheless
of very ancient origin.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>The account which the Egyptians and Manetho give
of the exodus of the Hebrews has been already related.
According to it the Hebrews are impure and leprous
Egyptians whom Pharaoh had banished to the quarries
east of the Nile, and made to work there, like other
Egyptians employed in that task. That the Hebrews
are Egyptians, and leprous Egyptians, in the Egyptian
tradition, need excite no astonishment; white leprosy
was a disease from which the Israelites frequently
suffered. We cannot contest the number of the lepers,
which Manetho puts at 80,000, though we have
already seen that the Hebrews at the time of the
exodus could hardly have approached this number of
men capable of work. The Hebrew tradition in both
texts represents the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh,
the descendants of Joseph and an Egyptian woman, as
growing up during the settlement in Egypt; the
revision adds that a "number of strangers" left Egypt
with their forefathers. Moses, the leader of the lepers,
is described by Manetho as an Egyptian priest of
Heliopolis, of the name of Osarsiph. We saw that
Heliopolis was the nearest centre of Egyptian religious
worship to the land of Goshen, and that the second
text gives the daughter of a priest of Heliopolis to
Joseph to wife. According to this text also Moses is
brought up by the Egyptians, and the revision calls
him an "Egyptian."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Hence we can at once accept
the statement of Manetho that the leader of the
Hebrews was skilled in the wisdom of the Egyptian
priests.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>  On the other hand the more detailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
narrative of Manetho is in itself far more improbable,
more full of contradictions and impossibilities, than
the account of the Hebrews. It does not agree with
the tenor of Manetho's narrative when we find
Pharaoh giving over the fortified city of Avaris to
the leprous Egyptians whom he had banished to the
stone quarries. In that city the lepers rebel, there
they make the priest of Heliopolis, Osarsiph, their
leader, and Osarsiph gives them the law, to worship
no god, to eat the most sacred animals, and to have
dealings only with their confederates. From hence
he summons the Hyksos, who had been driven out of
Avaris a long time before, and had meanwhile built
Jerusalem. Pharaoh goes with an army of 300,000
of the best warriors of Egypt against the conspirators,
80,000 unclean persons and 200,000 shepherds, yet
turns back voluntarily, and flies towards Ethiopia,
while the confederates desolate Egypt without pity for
thirteen years. It is hardly credible that a king of
Egypt should abandon his kingdom without a struggle
to lepers and the descendants of the Hyksos. And if
anyone is inclined to assume that the Hebrews did
actually combine, not with the supposed Hyksos of
Jerusalem, but perhaps with the Midianites, and
conquer Egypt and force the king into Ethiopia, and
so rule over Egypt for thirteen years&mdash;their tradition
would not have forgotten or suppressed such a glorious
achievement of the nation, such a proof of the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
of Jehovah. Compared with this wholly purposeless
exile of the king, the account of the Hebrews seems
far more credible&mdash;that Pharaoh did make the
attempt to stop the migration, but that the attempt
was without success.</p>

<p>It remains to fix the date at which the Hebrews
succeeded in escaping from the dominion of Egypt,
and resuming their old mode of life in the deserts of
Syria. It has already been proved that Sethos I. and
Ramses II. were the Pharaohs who oppressed the
Hebrews; and it is in harmony with the whole situation
to assume that the attempt to escape from this oppression
would be made under a less powerful successor.
If, as is shown above (<a href="#Page_159">p. 159</a>), the Pharaoh of
Manetho, who banished the lepers and retired before
them, was Menephta, the son and successor
of Ramses II., it would be Ramses II. before whom
Moses fled into the desert, and after his death he
would have returned and carried out against his son
the attempt he could not have ventured upon against
so powerful a ruler as Ramses II. Menephta's rule
falls in the years 1322 to 1302 <small>B.C.</small> Hence the exodus
of the Hebrews must be placed in this period, about
the year 1320 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The immigration into the land
of Goshen, we found that we might place about the
year 1550 <small>B.C.</small> (<a href="#Page_433">p. 433</a>). Hence they dwelt there about
230 years, and this lapse of time corresponds pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
closely to the eight generations which the table of
the leader under whom the Hebrews afterwards conquered
Canaan gave for the sojourn in Egypt (<a href="#Page_431">p. 431</a>).
When the Hebrews, after retiring from Egypt, wished
to give up the peninsula of Sinai, and settle themselves
in the east of Jordan, they besought "the king of
Edom," according to the second text, for a free
passage through his country. The first text knows
and mentions eight kings who had ruled over Edom
"before kings ruled over Israel." As the monarchy
was established in Israel about the year 1050 <small>B.C.</small> (see
below), eight generations would carry us two centuries
beyond the date of Saul, king of Israel, if this list
could be regarded as historical, but the two first names
in it seem of a mythical rather than a historical kind.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>The oldest accounts of western writers of the
fortunes of the Hebrews date from the time of the
successors of Alexander of Macedon. They were
founded partly on accounts of the Egyptians, and
partly on accounts of the Hebrews themselves. The
narrative of Hecataeus of Abdera, who was in Egypt
in the time of Ptolemy I., and wrote an Egyptian
history, gives us the most unprejudiced account, composed
from the widest point of view, and connects
the emigration of the Hebrews, whom he does not
consider Egyptians, with the supposed emigration
from Egypt to Greece. "Once, when a pestilence had
broken out in Egypt, the cause of the visitation was
generally ascribed to the anger of the gods. As
many strangers of various extraction dwelt in Egypt,
and observed different customs in religion and sacrifice,
it came to pass that the hereditary worship of the
gods was being given up in Egypt. The Egyptians,
therefore, were of opinion that they would obtain no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
alleviation of the evil unless they removed the
people of foreign extraction. When they were driven
out, the noblest and bravest part of them, as some
say, under noble and renowned leaders, Danaus and
Cadmus, came to Hellas; but the great bulk of
them migrated into the land, not far removed from
Egypt, which is now called Jud&aelig;a, and was at that
time without inhabitants. These emigrants were led
by Moses, who was the most distinguished among
them for wisdom and bravery. When he had settled
in the land he built several cities, among them
Jerusalem, which is now the most famous. He
also built the most celebrated temples, taught the
worship of the God, and the ritual, and arranged
the constitution, and gave laws. He divided the
people into twelve tribes, because this number is
the most complete, and corresponds to the number of
the months which make up the year. The most
handsome men, who could also at the same time guide
the united people best, he made priests, and arranged
that they should concern themselves with all that was
sacred, the religious worship and the sacrifices, and
at the same time he made them judges in the most
important matters, and put into their hands the
preservation of the laws and customs. He erected no
images of the gods, because he did not believe that
God had the form of men; he rather believed that
the heaven which surrounds the earth was alone god
and lord of all things. The sacrifices, too, and manner
of life he arranged unlike those of other people;
owing to their own banishment, he introduced among
them a misanthropic and inhospitable life. At the
end of his laws is written: This Moses has heard
from God, and tells it to the Jews. This lawgiver
also made provision for war, and compelled the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
men to exercise themselves in strength and manliness,
and the endurance of privations. He undertook
campaigns against the neighbouring nations, and
divided the conquered land by lot, and gave to the
priests larger lots than to the rest. But no one was
permitted to trade with his lot, in order that none
might from avarice buy up the lots and drive away
the more needy (by this is meant no doubt the
Hebrew year of Jubilee). He forced the people also
to bring up their children, and as it was possible to
do this with little cost, the tribes of the Jews were
always numerous. About their marriages and their
burials he laid down quite different laws from those
in use among other nations."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>When Antiochus Sidetes besieged Jerusalem in the
year 134 <small>B.C.</small>, and began to treat with the city, the
greater part of the counsellors of the king (so
Diodorus tells us) were of opinion that the Jews
ought to be destroyed, for of all nations they were
the only one who had no community with others, and
contracted no marriages with them, and regarded them
all as enemies. Their forefathers had been banished
out of the whole of Egypt as godless men, and
abhorred of heaven. At that time all who had white
leprosy, and scales upon the body, were collected as
being under a curse and sent over the border in
order to purify the land. The expelled persons had
then gathered together and formed the nation of the
Jews; they had taken the districts round about
Jerusalem, and propagated their hatred of mankind.
Hence they had adopted wholly different laws from
others. They were not to eat with strangers at one
table, or bear them any friendly feeling. When
Antiochus Epiphanes conquered the Jews (167 <small>B.C.</small>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
he went into the innermost shrine of the temple,
which only the priests might enter, and there he
found the stone image of a man with a long beard,
who was riding on an ass with a book in his hand.
This statue he took for an image of Moses, who had
founded Jerusalem, gathered the people together, and
given the wicked and misanthropic laws.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>Strabo remarks that southern Syria "was inhabited
by mixed tribes of Egyptian, Arabian, and Phenician
origin, but the prevailing legend of the temple at
Jerusalem called the ancestors of the Jews Egyptians.
For Moses, one of the Egyptian priests, who occupied
a part of this land, and was dissatisfied with his
condition, removed from that country, and many who
worshipped the deity emigrated with him, and Moses
told them and taught that the Egyptians were
not right in representing the divinity as a wild or
domesticated animal, nor the Libyans, nor were the
Hellenes wise in giving gods the form of men. For
only the One was God which surrounds us all and the
earth and the sea, and who was called Uranus and
Cosmos, and the nature of things. How could any
reasoning creature venture to make an image which
should truly represent this nature? All making of
images must be cast aside, a sacred place must be
marked off, and a temple erected, and prayers offered
without any image. In order to have fortunate
dreams it was needful to sleep in the sanctuary, and
those who were wise and lived with justice could
always expect signs and gifts from God. By such
doctrines Moses convinced not a few men of reason,
and led them to the place where Jerusalem now is.
He easily obtained possession of the land, because
it was not sufficiently valuable for anyone to fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
vigorously for it. It is rocky, and the district round
the city is without water. At the same time he
pretended to take it for the sake of the sanctity of
the place, and the deity for whom he sought a
dwelling, and established such a ritual and such
sacrificial customs, that the worshippers were not
compelled to undergo great expense, or vex themselves
by any ecstasies, contortions of the body, or vile occupation.
As this was well received, Moses established no
unimportant dominion, for those who dwelt round
about were induced by his speeches and promises to
join him. But at a later time superstitious and even
tyrannical men acquired the priesthood, and from
superstition the abstinences from food, circumcision,
and mutilation and other things of the kind became
law, and are observed even to this day. The capricious
nature of the ruling power ended in robbery, for the
insurgents plundered the land. But those who were
with the rulers subjugated even the border territories,
and conquered a good deal of Syria and Ph&#339;nicia.
Yet the fortress, which, instead of treating it as a place
of confinement they worshipped as a temple, retained
a certain dignity."<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>Better acquainted with the traditions of the Hebrews,
Nicolaus of Damascus tells us that Abraham came with
an army out of Chald&aelig;a, which lies beyond Babylon,
and ruled over Damascus. Not long after he again
set out from this place with his people, and established
himself in the land which was then called Chanan&aelig;a,
and afterwards Jud&aelig;a. Here he dwelt and his
numerous posterity. "The name of Abraham is still
praised in the region of Damascus, and a village is
pointed out which is called Abraham's dwelling, after
him."<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> This account, of which the continuation in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
the writings of Nicolaus is lost, was used, as it seems,
by Trogus Pompeius. His account survives only in
the excerpt of Justinus. "The Jews," so we find in
this excerpt, "derive their origin from Damascus, the
most famous city of Syria. This city took its name
from king Damascus, in whose honour the Syrians
revered the tomb of his wife Astarte as a temple, and
worshipped her as a goddess in the most sacred manner.
After Damascus, Azelus reigned, then Adores, then
Abraham, and lastly Israhel. Israhel became more
famous than his predecessors, for he had ten sons
to help him. So he left the nation divided into ten
kingdoms to his sons, and called them after the name
of Juda, who died after the division, Jud&aelig;ans, and
commanded that his memory should be held in
honour by all, because his share had profited all
the others. The youngest of the brothers was
Joseph. The others were afraid of his pre-eminent
gifts, and secretly they got him into their power, and
sold him to foreign merchants. By these he was
carried to Egypt, and as he gave his mind eagerly to
the magic arts of the place, he was soon in high estimation
even with the king. For he was the most acute
expounder of signs and wonders, and first founded
the interpretation of dreams. Nothing in divine or
human ordinances seemed hidden from him; he even
foresaw the unfruitfulness of the land many years before
it came. The whole of Egypt would have been
destroyed by famine had not the king, at Joseph's
suggestion, ordered corn to be laid by for many years
previously, and he gave such proofs of his wisdom
that his answers seemed to be those of a god and not
of a man. His son was Moses, who in addition to
the inheritance of his father's wisdom, received also
great beauty of person. But at the bidding of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
oracle the Egyptians banished him, because they were
afflicted with scab and leprosy, with all the diseased
persons beyond their borders, so that he might not
infect more. Chosen to be leader of the exiles, Moses
took from the Egyptians their sacred things. The
Egyptians rose to recover them by force of arms,
but were compelled to return by storms. Then
Moses as he turned towards his old fatherland,
Damascus, settled on Mount Syna. As he came there
with his people exhausted after seven days' privations
in the deserts of Arabia, he consecrated each
seventh day a fast for all time. After the manner of
the people this day was called Sabbata, because it had
put an end to the hunger and wandering. And when
they remembered that they had been driven out of
Egypt from fear of contamination, they were careful
that they should not be hated by the inhabitants
from the same causes and had no dealings with them,
which rule in time became a strict custom and
religious observance. After Moses, his son Arvas
became priest of the Egyptian sacred things, and was
soon after chosen to be king. Since then it became a
custom among the Jews that their priests should be
at the same time kings, and their duties as judges,
combined with the worship of the god, held the nation
uncommonly close together."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>The most marvellous story is that of Lysimachus
of Alexandria, who brings down the exodus of the
Jews to the eighth century <small>B.C.</small> "At the time of
king Bocchoris, unclean and leprous men had come
into the temples to beg for food. Hence there was
a blight in the land; and Bocchoris received a
response from Ammon, that the temples must be
purified. The lepers, as if the sun were angry at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
their existence, were to be plunged into the sea,
and the unclean were to be driven out of the land.
Hence the lepers were tied to plates of lead, and
thrown into the sea; but the unclean were driven
out helpless into the desert. These met together in
council; in the night they lit fires and lights, and
called, fasting, upon the gods to save them. Then
a certain Moses advised them to go through the
desert till they came to inhabited regions, but at
the same time required them to show kindness to no
man, to advise every one for the worst, and to destroy
all altars and temples upon which they came. The
exiles approved, and after many hardships came
through the desert to an inhabited land, and after
treating the men cruelly, robbing and burning the
temples, they established a city Hierosyla (temple-plunder)
in Jud&aelig;a, and afterwards, to lessen the
disgrace, the name was slightly altered into Hierosolyma
(Jerusalem)."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>Even this narrative was accepted and believed.
Tacitus first enumerated the different views of the
writers on the origin of the Jews, in order finally
to agree in all essential points with the narrative
of Lysimachus. "According to the view of some,"
Tacitus says, "the Jews were descendants of the
Ethiopians, whom fear and disinclination compelled,
at the time of king Kepheus, to change their dwelling;
others say that a horde coming from Assyria
gained possession of a part of Egypt, and soon after
passed into the neighbouring parts of Syria, and
inhabited the Hebrew land and cities." The latter
statement obviously confounds the immigration of
the Hyksos and the Jews, and makes them a
mingled horde of Assyrians, but still is nearest the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
truth. "Others, again," Tacitus continues, "are of
opinion that under the rule of Isis in Egypt, the
number of men became too great, and the superfluous
multitudes were settled under the leadership
of Hierosolymus and Judah in the neighbouring
lands. But most authorities agree that under king
Bocchoris a contagious disease raged in Egypt, and
the oracle of Ammon bade them purify the kingdom
and remove the diseased persons out of the land
as a race hated by the gods. Hence the unclean
were collected and left behind in the desert. Amid
their idle lamentations one of the exiles, Moses,
warned them that they had no assistance to expect
from gods or men, for they were abandoned by both,
but they were to trust to him as a heavenly leader
by whose assistance they might be rescued from their
present calamities. To this they agreed, and in
complete ignorance struck out a path at random.
The want of water distressed them most, and almost
at death's door they sank upon the ground, when
a herd of wild asses ran from the pasture to a rock
covered with trees. Moses followed them, and found
copious streams of water. This saved them, and after
a march of six days they came on the seventh day
to a region where, when they had expelled the inhabitants,
they founded a city and a temple. In
order to strengthen the nation and establish his own
supremacy, Moses gave them new customs, quite
opposed to the usages of the rest of the world. What
we consider sacred, they regard as profane; and what
is permitted to us is forbidden to them. The image
of the animal which had shown them an escape from
their wanderings, and put an end to their thirst, they
placed in the innermost shrine, after they had slain
a ram. in order, as it were, to throw contempt upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
Ammon. They abstained from swine's flesh in remembrance
of the misery which the leprosy, to which
this animal is subject, had once brought upon them.
The long hunger which they then endured they still
avow by frequent fasts; and as a proof of the
fruits once stolen, their bread is unleavened. On
the seventh day they rest, because the seventh day
brought them to an end of their labours; the seventh
year also, induced by their laziness, they have given
up to inaction. Others are of opinion that this is
done in honour of Saturn, because Saturn completes
the highest circle of all the seven stars which rule
the fortunes of men, and is of pre-eminent power,
and most constellations accomplish their influence and
their orbits by the number seven.</p>

<p>"Other abominable customs have come into force
owing to their vile corruption. For all the worst
of men, despising their hereditary religions, brought
money and contributions to them; and because among
them stiffnecked belief and ready assistance was to
be found, and deadly hatred towards the rest of the
world, their power increased. They do not eat with
strangers or make marriages with them; and this
nation, otherwise most prone to debauchery, abstains
from all strange women. They have introduced
circumcision in order to distinguish themselves
thereby; and those who have adopted their customs
follow this practice. The first lesson learnt by their
youth is to hate the gods, to despise their country, to
disregard parents, children, and brothers. Yet they
take considerable care to increase their numbers.
It is a sin to slay a kinsman, and the souls of
all slain in battle and by execution they consider immortal.
Hence they have a lively impulse to beget
children, and they hold death in contempt. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
custom of burying the dead, instead of burning
them, they have borrowed from the Egyptians; on
the other hand, the Jews alone worship in the spirit
a single deity, while the Egyptians offer prayer
to many animals and composite images. They
also consider it profane to make any images of God
out of perishable material in the form of men, for
the deity is the Highest, the Eternal, the Unchangeable
and Imperishable. Hence in their cities and
temples there are no images. As their priests
use the music of flutes and drums, and wear crowns
of ivy, and a golden vine was found in the temple,
some have thought that they worshipped the conqueror
of the East, the god Bacchus. But the rites
are widely different. Bacchus inaugurated blithe
and merry festivals; but the customs of the Jews
are absurd and melancholy.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE HEBREWS IN THE DESERT.</h3>


<p>The fortunes and achievements of the Israelites
after leaving Egypt and escaping the pursuit of the
Egyptians, are narrated in the second, third, and
fourth books of the Pentateuch in the following
manner. From the reed-sea the Israelites marched
into the wilderness of Shur, and for three days found
no water. When they came to Marah, they could
not drink the water there, because it was bitter.
Then Jehovah showed Moses a piece of wood, and
he threw it into the water, so that the water became
sweet. From Marah they came to Elim, where were
twelve wells and seventy palm-trees, and they encamped
there by the water. From Elim they came
into the wilderness of Sin, and the people murmured
against Moses, because there was no food to be found;
but at evening Jehovah caused swarms of quails to rise
which covered the camp, and in the morning manna
had fallen, which lay like hoar frost upon the ground,
and the people were allowed to gather manna for six
days, but on the seventh they were not allowed to
gather it. And Israel set forth from the wilderness
of Sin and encamped at Rephidim. There there was
no water to drink, and the people were angry with
Moses; but Jehovah said to Moses: Take thy staff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
with which thou didst smite the Nile; thou shalt
smite the rock, and the water shall flow forth. And
Moses did so before all Israel, and they called the
name of the place Massah and Meribah. And Amalek
came and strove with Israel in Rephidim, and was
smitten down with the edge of the sword. And
Jethro, the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of
Moses, came and advised Moses to choose valiant
men for his helpers, as overseers over the people
and judges for the matters of smaller moment. And
Moses did so.</p>

<p>In the third month after the exodus from Egypt,
the Israelites set forth from Rephidim, and came into
the desert of Sinai, and encamped over against the
mountain. The people were commanded to purify
themselves and wash their garments, and Moses
forbad any one to approach the mountain. On the
third day, when it was morning, there was thunder and
lightning, and a thick cloud stood upon the mountain,
and there was a mighty sound of trumpets. And all
the people heard the thunder and saw the flames and
the smoking mountain, and the mountain quaked, and
all trembled. But Moses led them to meet Jehovah
at the foot of the mountain. And Jehovah came down
to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. For
forty days and forty nights Moses was on the mountain,
and Jehovah revealed to him his laws, and the
finger of God wrote them on two stone tables. And
Jehovah spoke to Moses out of the darkness, and told
him all the ordinances which he should lay upon the
people. But the cloud covered the mountain, and the
glory of Jehovah was a consuming fire on the top of
the mountain.</p>

<p>When the people saw that Moses delayed to come
down from the mountain, the people said to Aaron:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
We know not what has happened to the man who led
us out of Egypt; make us a god to go before us. And
Aaron said to them: Take off the golden rings which
are in the ears of your wives, your daughters, and
your sons. They brought him the rings, and he made
of them a golden calf, and built an altar before the
calf. Then they said: That is the god, who led us
out of Egypt; and Aaron caused a festival to be
proclaimed to Jehovah, and they brought a thank-offering
to the calf, and the people ate and drank
and stood up to dance. But when Moses came down
from the mountain with the stone tablets in his hand,
and heard the singing and shouting, and saw the calf
and the dancing, his anger was kindled. He cast the
tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of
the mountain, and took the calf, and burned it with
fire, and ground it to dust, and strewed it on the
water, and made the children of Israel drink it. And
Moses came into the entrance of the camp and cried:
Come to me, all who belong to Jehovah. Then the
descendants of Levi gathered round him. Take everyone
his sword at his side, he said to them; go from
one gate of the camp to the other, and slay every
man his brother, his friend, and his neighbour. And
there fell on that day about 3,000 men of the people.</p>

<p>On the next morning Moses said: Ye have sinned
a great sin; I will go up to Jehovah, perhaps I can
appease him for your sin. And Jehovah said to
Moses: Hew two stone tables like the others, and
be ready in the morning, and appear before me on
the top of the mountain. And Moses was there with
Jehovah forty days and forty nights, and ate no
bread, and drank no water, and he wrote on the
tables the ten commandments. Then he came down
with the two tables of the law in his hand, and told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
the people the commandments which Jehovah had
given him, and the laws; and the people answered:
All that Jehovah has commanded we will do. Then
Moses built an altar and twelve pillars for the twelve
tribes. And the young men slew burnt-offerings and
thank-offerings, and the half of the blood Moses
sprinkled on the altar, and with the other half he
sprinkled the people, and said: This is the blood of
the covenant which Jehovah makes with you over
all laws.</p>

<p>Then Moses set up the tent of the assembly for a
sanctuary of Jehovah, that He might dwell in their
midst, as Jehovah had commanded, with planks of
acacia wood on silver feet, and fastened them with
silver bars; and on them he placed a cover of woven
cloth of byssus, of a purple colour, and over this a
second roof of red sheep-skins and seal-skins, and
divided the tent by a curtain of blue and red purple,
and carmine, and byssus, with cherubs woven upon it.
And in the tent behind the second curtain he placed
the ark of the law, as Jehovah had commanded, of
acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold, and placed the
law in the ark. Then Moses made a table of acacia
wood, overlaid with pure gold, and placed bowls of
pure gold upon it for the drink-offerings, and laid
the sacrificial bread upon the table. And he made
a candlestick of pure gold, with seven lamps, three
on the one side and three on the other side of the
candlestick. Then he made the altar of incense of
acacia wood, overlaid with gold; and the altar of
burnt sacrifice of acacia wood, as Jehovah commanded,
and overlaid it with copper; and made the curtains
for the court and the poles for the curtains of copper.
The Israelites brought what was necessary for the
erection and adornment of the shrine, and gave their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
nose-rings, ear-rings, seals, and ear-drops. And Moses
made Aaron and his sons priests, and anointed the
altars and all utensils with holy ointment, and sanctified
the fire on the altar, and offered burnt-offerings.
But two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, brought
strange fire before Jehovah; then fire went forth
from Jehovah and consumed them, and they died
before Him. And the glory of Jehovah filled His
habitation, and the cloud covered the tent of assembly;
and when the cloud rose, the children of
Israel set forth, and by night there was fire in the
cloud.</p>

<p>In the second year after the exodus from Egypt, in
the second month, on the twentieth day of the month,
the cloud rose from the dwelling of the law, and the
children of Israel set forth on their march out of the
desert of Sinai, from the mountain of Jehovah, and
they went three days' journey, and the cloud halted
in the wilderness of Paran. And Jehovah bade Moses
send men to search out the land of Canaan&mdash;one for
each tribe from among the leaders. And from Ephraim
Moses sent Joshua the son of Nun; and from the tribe
of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. Then the
twelve princes set forth at the time of the first
grapes, and came to Hebron and to the valley of
Eshcol, and there cut a bunch of grapes and a vine,
and carried them on a pole between two; and they
also took of the pomegranates and the figs. After
forty days they returned, and said to the people:
The land into which you sent us flows with milk and
honey, and these are its fruits. But the people is
mighty, and their cities are large and fortified, and
Amalek dwells in the land to the south, and the
Hittites, and Jebusites, and Amorites dwell on the
mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
on the side of Jordan. And Caleb said: We will
go up and overpower them; but the others said:
We cannot go up against that people, for they are
mightier than we; and the sons of Israel cried: Why
should we fall by the sword, and our wives and children
fall into the hand of the enemy; is it not better to
return to Egypt? Then Jehovah said to Moses: All
those who have murmured against me shall not enter
into the land wherein I have lifted up my hand to
cause you to dwell. Your bodies shall lie in the
desert, save Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua,
the son of Nun; and your children shall pasture their
flocks in the desert forty years: forty years shall my
face be turned from you.  And Moses told these
words to the children of Israel. But the Israelites
ventured to rise up and went to the heights of the
mountains on the way towards Atharim. But the
Amalekites and Canaanites who dwelt on the mountains
came down and smote them, and scattered them
as far as Hormah.</p>

<p>And Korah of the tribe of Levi, and Dathan and
Abiram of the tribe of Reuben, and two hundred and
fifty of the foremost men, heads of families and
officers of the community, assembled themselves
against Moses and Aaron, and said: Why do ye lift
yourselves up against the people? And to Moses they
said: Is it not enough that thou hast led us out of
Egypt, to slay us in the desert? Wilt thou also make
thyself a ruler over us? But the earth opened her
mouth and swallowed them up. On the next morning
the people murmured in the assembly against Moses
and Aaron, and said: Ye have slain them. But
Jehovah said to Moses: Go out from this company;
I will destroy them suddenly. Then the plague
began. At Moses' command Aaron took the censer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
of incense and offered incense to purify the children
of Israel; and he stood between the living and the
dead, and the plague was stayed. But there died
fourteen thousand and seven hundred.</p>

<p>The children of Israel came into the wilderness of
Sin, and Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom,
saying: Let us pass through thy land; we will go
along the highway, and turn neither to the right
hand nor to the left. But Edom went to meet them
with mighty hosts and a powerful hand, and Israel
retired before him, and went from Kadesh to Mount
Hor, and from Mount Hor to the reed-sea. Then the
people became impatient on the way, and murmured
against Moses, and Jehovah sent the serpents, the
saraphs, among the people, and many died. Then
the Israelites saw that they had sinned, and Moses
prayed for the people and made a serpent of copper,
and set it up on a pole, and all who were bitten by
the serpents and looked upon the image of copper
were saved. From the reed-sea the Israelites went
again to the north, towards Oboth and Beer, to the
well which the princes dug. Then Israel sang:
"Rise up, O fountain, meet him with songs; O well
which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people
hollowed out with their sceptre and their staves."
And from Beer they went to Bamoth, and from
Bamoth to Pisgah, which rises over the desert. And
Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in his city at
Heshbon, gathered all his people and went to meet
Israel in the desert, and came towards Jahaz, and
strove with Israel. Then Israel smote him with the
edge of the sword, laid waste the land, and took the
cities. And Israel sang: "Fire went forth from
Heshbon, and flames from the city of Sihon; we shot
at them, we laid waste the land to Nophah, we burnt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
it with fire to Medeba." Then the Israelites turned
and went up against Og, the king of the Amorites of
Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth Karnaim, and smote
him at Edrei, and his sons and all his people, and his
cities were taken, and not a fugitive escaped. From
Bashan Israel went southwards, and encamped in the
plains of Moab at Shittim; and they began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and served
Baal Peor. And Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron,
pierced with his spear Zimri, a captain of the tribe of
Simeon, as he lay with a Midianitish woman, and
slew both with one thrust through the belly. And
Jehovah said to Moses: Go up to Mount Abarim and
see the land which I have given to the children of
Israel, and when thou hast seen it, thou shalt be
gathered to thy people. Take Joshua, the son of
Nun, and lay thy hand on him, and place him before
Eleazar the priest (the son of Aaron), and before all
the people, so that all may obey him; and Eleazar
shall inquire of Jehovah for him, and as he commands
he shall go out and in. And Moses did as Jehovah
commanded. And the sons of Reuben and Gad said
to Moses: The land which Jehovah has smitten before
Israel is a land for flocks, and thy servants have
flocks; and to them, and half of the tribe of Manasseh,
Moses gave the land of Gilead. And Moses
went up from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah,
over against Jericho, and Jehovah caused him to see
the whole land from Gilead to Dan, and from Jericho
to Zoar. And there Moses died, a hundred and
twenty years old. But his eyes were not dim, nor had
his strength forsaken him. The Israelites mourned for
Moses thirty days in the plains of Moab, and henceforth
there was no prophet in Israel like Moses; and
to this day no man knows the grave of Moses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>In those portions which deal with the abode and
fortunes of the Hebrews in the desert, the two texts
were less closely combined, and the contradictions are
more numerous, than in the other parts. The two
narratives are interpolated each into the other, and
the additions of the reviser are more prominent than
elsewhere. An ancient record, embodied in the first
text, gives a list of the places where the Israelites
pitched their tents between Egypt and the Jordan.
The statements do not agree with the narrative in its
present condition. In the first text the Midianites
manifestly dwell to the east of the Jordan. It represents
the Israelites as taking vengeance upon them,
because they had seduced Israel to a heathenish ritual;
first by the act of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron,
whose seed in consequence received "the everlasting
covenant of the priesthood," and then by the war which
cost the Midianites a vast booty of sheep, oxen,
asses, and thousands of prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> In the Ephraimitic
text the Midianites dwell on Sinai; hither Moses
fled to the Midianites from Egypt; he married the
daughter of the priest of the Midianites, and stands
in most friendly relations with them. This text represents
the seduction of the Israelites as the work
not of the Midianites, but of the Moabites; and
subsequently narrates the victories over the Moabites
of Heshbon and Bashan. How the first text described
the conquest of the land of Gilead we cannot any
longer ascertain; that it dealt with the subject is
beyond question.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>The setting up of the golden calf at Sinai is inconceivable
in the connection in which the narrative
places it. While Jehovah's glory is visible on Sinai,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
and proclaims itself in thunder and lightning, would
the people, and Aaron at their head, have required an
image of God, and offered prayer to it? When after
the death of Solomon the ten tribes founded their
independent kingdom Jehovah was worshipped among
them in the form of a bull, in contrast to the
worship of the kingdom of Judah. To stigmatise
this worship, wherein priests of the family which
claimed to be derived from Aaron may have taken
part from the first, as objectionable, the prophetic
revision has interpolated the adoration of the golden
calf and the punishment of such idolatry; and
from this the second ascent of Sinai by Moses came
into the narrative. The account of the saraphs
and the setting up of the brazen serpent belongs to
the Ephraimitic text.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> At Jerusalem there was a
serpent of brass, which was thought to have come
down from Moses.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>It was the fixed belief of the Hebrews that it was only
by the immediate help of Jehovah that their forefathers
had been able to escape the power of Egypt. And
this was not the only thing done for their fathers;
they had afterwards gained abodes to the east and west
of the Jordan, and from the wilderness they had come
into a land flowing with milk and honey. Here, also,
the help of Jehovah had been shown forth mightily
for his people, against the old and powerful cities,
and the mountain fortresses of Canaan. Obviously
Jehovah had delivered his people out of Egypt, in
order to give them this beautiful and rich land for a
dwelling. But why had he not at once led them
thither? Why did the Israelites remain so long in
the miserable wilderness? The Israelites&mdash;so the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
text explains this delay&mdash;received the account of the
spies with fear. This cowardly generation, therefore,
must die out. We saw above that the Hebrews
reckoned the length of a generation at forty years,
and so the first text puts the sojourn in the desert at
forty years. We shall see below that this period is
too short by some decads of years. Moses and Aaron
also did not reach Canaan, because, as the first text
says, "they sinned against Jehovah at the water
of strife, at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Sin," because
"they rebelled against his command at the water,"
an obstinacy which cannot be any longer found in the
revised narrative of this occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> If Joshua and
Caleb are exempted from this decree, if they alone
reach Canaan, it was certain that Joshua had undertaken
and carried out the attack upon Canaan, that
Caleb conquered Hebron and subjected the surrounding
district; his descendants were living there even
in David's time in princely wealth.</p>

<p>In the desert also Jehovah had taken care of his
people; he had not allowed them to perish there; he
had sent quails and given them manna. Even now
long lines of quails pass over the Syrian steppes and
the wilderness of Sinai, and in the neighbourhood of
Firan, manna, i.e. the juice running from the branches
and leaves of the tamarisk, is still gathered.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> Nor
had Jehovah allowed water to fail in the midst of the
desert. Moses changed a bitter spring into sweet
water. The story rests, no doubt, on the name of the
spring. Marah means bitter. At another spring of
the name of Meribah, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> strife (here Jehovah bade
the rocks give water), the rebellion of Moses and
Aaron is said to have taken place. The well of Beer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
which the princes dug, cannot be any other than the
well of Beer Elim, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the well of the strong,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and the
song which tradition connects with this place (<a href="#Page_473">p. 473</a>)
is certainly very old, if not contemporary.</p>

<p>The law made known to Moses on Sinai forms the
main portion of the second, third, and fourth books
of the Pentateuch. It not only contains the fundamental
moral rules, the ordinances of the law of
family and blood-feud, and the rubrics for the national
worship; it is rather a law for the priesthood,
given in systematic detail, which fixes their position,
rights, and honours, the dress of their office, and the
fees for the sacrifice&mdash;a wide collection of regulations
for the ritual of sacrifice, descending into the smallest
minuti&aelig;, the place of worship, the instruments
of sacrifice, the celebration of festivals, and the
arrangement of life in the future dwellings of the
tribes. Could tribes wandering in the desert have
made rules for the celebration of the festivals of sowing,
of harvest, and of the vintage? Could they have
settled what part of the produce of the field should be
given to the priests, and how they should deal with
the fallow time of the seventh year of rest, and the
reversion of the alienated land in the year of Jubilee?
Could dwellers in tents make regulations about
receiving the stranger in their gates, about cities of
refuge and cities of the Levites? And even if this
had really taken place, how are we to explain the fact
that whole groups of arrangements for worship and
life which these laws prescribe were demonstrably not
in existence among the Hebrews in the centuries
following their wandering? Laws are never created
except in connection with definite circumstances; no
lawgiver can anticipate the relations which the future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
will bring into existence, and answer, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, the
questions which will then arise.</p>

<p>It is therefore beyond doubt that views and tendencies
of later development and the results of a long course of
growth have been transferred to early times, the times
of the exodus from Egypt. Those early days had been
an era of original piety, and the time of the exodus
had been a period in which the God of the fathers had
guided and led them with a mighty hand, in which
he had announced to them his will directly and
without deception. The condition of religious service
and life, therefore, which was held to be the true and
proper kind must have been prescribed in those early
days and have existed then; the ideal after which
men were to strive, and in the pursuit of which
every hindrance was to be removed, must have
already existed in those days of direct divine guidance.
Thus ordinances and usages which arose successively
after the settlement in Canaan, were amalgamated
with older customs and rules, and united into one
system, which seemed to the priests the necessary
system, appointed by God and pleasing to him. The
position which the first text ascribes to Aaron, and
which the laws attached to that text, give to the
priests and Levites the prominence of a centralised,
rich, and even splendid ritual, and of a single place
for the worship of Jehovah, display the tendency
which was active in the priesthood, to concentrate the
worship of Jehovah on a single spot, and to obtain
power in the state for the chief priests. The gorgeous
tabernacle erected near Mount Sinai with the portable
altars for burnt sacrifice and incense, the implements
of sacrifice and the candlestick of seven branches, can
only have been taken from the tabernacle erected by
David, and afterwards from the temple of Solomon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
and its glory, the sacred pattern of which ought
to be recognised in the movable sanctuary already
erected by Moses on Mount Sinai. At the same time
the rich adornment of this pattern by the voluntary
offerings of the Israelites proved how ready the
nation was at that time to honour their God and
dedicate their property to him. For these descriptions
there was a historical foundation in the fact that the
Israelites had carried their national sanctuary, the
sacred ark, the Ark of the Covenant, into the desert,
that it had been placed under a movable tent, and
before the tent the heads of the tribes and the nation
had gathered for sacrifice and counsel. In the position
of Aaron and his family we have a pattern which
brings clearly into light the attributes and advantages,
the rights and honours, which belonged to the chief
priests and priests in contrast to the Levites or
servants of the temple. The fearful punishments
which awaited offences against ritual and neglect of
the priestly rules were strongly marked. Even two
sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, die because they
approach Jehovah with unconsecrated fire; and when
the Levite Korah, and Dathan and Abiram of the
tribe of Reuben, rebel against Moses and Aaron, they
were swallowed up by the earth, and Jehovah smites
the people who follow them.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> It is the ideal picture
of the priesthood, and arrangement of the Church,
which those laws exhibit, and transfer to that mighty
time when Jehovah spoke to the Israelites through
Moses.</p>

<p>The intention of the Israelites in the exodus from
Egypt could not at first go further than the attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
to escape from the dominion of Egypt, and resume
the old free life in the desert. That the line of march
at first attempted to pass along the western shore of
the reed-sea, and reach the south of the peninsula of
Sinai, in order to get as far as possible from Egypt,
place the whole length of the protecting arm of the
sea between the emigrants and Egypt, and reach the
pasture lands of the apparently friendly Midianites,
corresponds to the situation. Nor can it in any way
surprise us that the Amalekites, as the Ephraimitic
text states, opposed the Hebrews, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> contested the
possession of the pasture-lands and oases of the
wildernesses of Shur and Paran, with the new-comers.
The Israelites obtained the victory. So they arrived
at Sinai, the sacred mountain of the wilderness of
Sin. Between the two bays with which the sea
encloses this peninsula, that mountain rises, a naked
granite ridge, with five steep peaks, united into a
mighty crown, above the plateau of sandstone which
occupies the whole peninsula. The height is 8,000
feet, and the wild and rugged mass overlooks in
sublime solitude the broad and desert flats in the
north, and the waves of the sea in the south. The
beautiful oasis at the foot of the mountain (Wadi
Firan) affords nourishment for a large number of men
and beasts.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> On the old and sacred mountain the
Israelites might believe that they approached nearer
to their deity; that here thanksgiving and sacrifice for
their happy deliverance could best be offered to him.
Then the Israelites would pasture their flocks on the
slopes and glades of the peninsula. But they may
have found but scanty food beside the flocks of the
Midianites, and the security from Egypt would be
greater, if they removed to a greater distance from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
that country. On the southern borders of Canaan,
at Kadesh and Hormah, they sought better pastures.
Yet they were driven back, and pursued as far as
Hormah. After this misadventure, the Israelites,
according to the Ephraimitic text, besought the king
of Edom to allow them a peaceful passage through
Edom, "on the road of the king, they would not turn
either to the right or the left." Hence the defeat
must have been a serious one.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> The object of this
march through Edom can only have been to find new
pasture-lands in the Syrian steppes beyond Mount
Seir on the east. The wide extent of the Syrian
desert would certainly supply sufficient pastures,
and the distance from the Nile was a good protection
from Egypt. As the Edomites refused the
demand, and showed themselves prepared to resist
the march by force of arms, the Israelites did not
venture to give battle; they preferred to retire to the
south, and make a long circuit round the territory of
the Edomites, by marching through the whole length
of the valley of Arabah southward to Elath, as far
as the north-east point of the reed-sea. From this
point they passed to the other side of Mount Seir, past
Punon and Oboth, towards the Arnon, which falls
into the Dead Sea. If they could at first maintain
themselves on the east, in the desert, the uplands on
the left bank of the Jordan were far better than the
steppes of the desert. The arms of the Israelites
were here more fortunate than on the other side of
the Dead Sea. The Amorites of Heshbon, eastward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
of the Dead Sea, were defeated at Jahaz, and their
cities taken. The song which celebrates this victory
(<a href="#Page_473">p. 473</a>) is old, and above suspicion. From this point,
out of the newly-conquered land, from the top of
Pisgah&mdash;a mountain near Heshbon&mdash;Moses is said to
have seen the promised land. A second victory over
the Amorites lying to the north beyond the Jabbok,
the people of Edrei and Ashtaroth Karnaim, opened
ample pasture-lands to the Israelites, and also some
well-watered valleys on the wide plateau to the east of
the Jordan. Their territory now reached from the
Arnon northwards to the Jarmuk. Here the nation
remained; the greater part tended their flocks as
hitherto, the lesser part applied themselves to agriculture
in exceptionally fruitful valleys.</p>

<p>Though a peaceful race of shepherds and unused to
arms, the Hebrews had bidden defiance to the strong
arm of Pharaoh; with bold resolution they had successfully
delivered themselves from a cruel slavery;
and had preserved their freedom, their national
character, and their religion. Beyond the borders of
Egypt and the reed-sea, the lively perception of their
liberation, and the recovery of their ancient mode of
life, and of the visible protection of their God, must
have aroused a mighty impulse, especially in their
great leader. It was a moment of great elevation.
Together with the valley of the Nile, they had left
behind the gods of Egypt; and they returned to the
worship of their old deity with strengthened and
deepened feelings. Thus on Sinai Moses could inculcate
the exclusive worship of Jehovah&mdash;a worship without
images&mdash;and the consecration of the seventh day.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
These were commands consciously and diametrically
opposed to the multitude of Egyptian gods, the
variety of their forms and modes of worship, and the
times of their festivals. In connection with these
commands, and the customs of sacrifice in use among
the Israelites, regulations were given for purification,
and rules, telling how to proceed at the erection
of altars, at purifications and expiations, at burnt-offerings,
thank-offerings, and offerings of corn and
meal; rules which were preserved and developed in
the family of Aaron.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> Even for the establishment of
this ritual the contrast to the Egyptian was not
without influence. This contrast was in fact so strong
that what was best in the Egyptian religion&mdash;the
belief in the existence of the soul after death, and in
its awaking from death to a new life, was not adopted
by the Israelites. Of the care shown to the corpses
of the dead in Egypt, we find no trace.</p>

<p>We saw what a long series of moral rules were
set up in Egypt. For his people Moses collected
the foundations of moral and religious law into a
simpler, purer, deeper, and more earnest form, in the
Ten Commandments.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> In connecting the moral law
with the worship of Jehovah, its inseparable foundation,
and setting it up with passionate earnestness
as the immediate command of the God of Israel,
Moses imparted to his people that character of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
religious earnestness, and ethical struggling, which
distinguishes their history from that of every other
nation. With the decalogue were connected the
regulations for peace in the nation, the law of the
family, and the avenging of blood. One who curses
father or mother must be put to death. One who
strikes father or mother must be put to death. One
who strikes a man so that he dies must be put to
death. One who has slain a man without intention,
by misadventure, must flee to the altar. But if
anyone sins against another so as to slay him by
craft, thou shalt take him from the altar that he
may die. If men strive with one another, and one is
injured, thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth
for tooth, foot for foot, burn for burn, bruise for bruise.
If any man strike his man-servant or his maid-servant
with his staff, and they die under his hand, vengeance
must be taken. If thou buyest a Hebrew servant, he
shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go
free. The long service in Egypt was still held in
lively remembrance.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>Just as the ordinances of Moses for religious worship
again brought into prominence the ancient customs
of the Hebrews, purified and developed them, so his
regulations for peace, for revenge, and expiation, for
injury to the person, and theft, were connected with
ancient customs of the children of Jacob, which could
hardly have been entirely forgotten in Egypt. As
Moses attached his law to the old customs, permeating
them with the depth of his own ethical point of view,
a certain stock of sayings must have been formed,
which were preserved and further developed by the
decisions of the heads of the tribes, the leaders of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
families, and the elders and the priests. The code
in Exodus is taken from an old document, though
apparently first inserted by the revision.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>The Israelites had risen from a tribe into a nation,
which stood in need of organisation when it was no
longer under Egyptian dominion. This arrangement
must be founded upon the connection of families and
races, on respect for the tie of blood, and reverence
for age. No other political division was known but
community of family and descent. Affinities and
races were in existence which carried back their origin
to one patriarch, they followed the head of the
oldest family, from whom the rest were derived, or
thought that they were derived, and usually obeyed
his decision. Some of these races carried their pedigree
back to Jacob and his sons. After the pattern
of these connections, and by adopting and adding
to them, the whole nation was brought into ties
of relationship. Strangers and families without a
name must have here been in part allotted to the
affinities already in existence, and partly formed into
new corporations, and new affinities, so that in the
total there were some seventy groups of families.
Those derived from the old stocks, who carried their
origin back to the same son of Jacob, formed together
a large community, or tribe, and were accustomed to
obey the nearest descendant of the patriarch, the son
of his oldest son, from first-born to first-born, and
thus the head of the oldest family in the whole community,
as their tribal prince and leader by birth. In
the same manner, also, the new groups of families
became amalgamated into tribes, and older families
were put at their head as chiefs of the tribe, in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
manner that from three to ten groups of families
formed a tribe.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Thus twelve tribes were formed. Even
the nations most closely allied to the Hebrews, the
Nahorites, and Ishmaelites, were divided into twelve
tribes; the Edomites were apparently divided into
sixteen. The tribes already in existence were derived
from definite progenitors, the sons of Jacob; and also
for the new tribes one of the sons of Jacob, the
number of whom has thus been fixed, was allotted as
a patriarch. Reuben, Simeon, and Judah, were Jacob's
eldest sons, borne by Leah his first wife in lawful
marriage. From these three the oldest groups were
derived. With the tribes of Issachar and Zebulon
families were connected, whose antiquity did not go
so far back, and thus Issachar and Zebulon were held
to be younger sons of Jacob by the same wife. The
tribes of Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, were not
considered equally pure; perhaps because additional
families had been incorporated in them: hence, as we
saw, their progenitors are said to be the sons of Jacob
by his handmaids. The tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh,
and Benjamin, are marked as of later origin by the
fact that they are carried back to Jacob and Rachel;
and if Joseph begot his sons Ephraim and Manasseh
with the daughter of the priest of Heliopolis, this
leads to the conclusion that the families incorporated
into the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh had grown
up in Egypt, and had Egyptian blood in their veins.
But Ephraim was at the same time the strongest
tribe, which in numbers and bravery outstripped the
rest, and the later origin is compensated by the
importance of Rachel and Joseph. The Egyptian
element which Ephraim and Manasseh introduced
among the Hebrews cannot have been of any im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>portance,
for neither the language nor the ideas of the
Hebrews incorporated elements from Egypt. Only
a few external touches in the dress of the priests can
be carried back with certainty to Egyptian influence.
Of the two sons of Joseph, Manasseh is the elder,
Ephraim the younger. Hence the groups of families
incorporated into the first, must have been considered
the older, or the tribe of Manasseh must at one time
have had precedence of Ephraim, which may have
been the case about the time of Gideon.</p>

<p>If in the place of Joseph, the eleventh son of
Jacob, two grandsons are adopted into the number of
the patriarchs, room is made by excluding Levi, a son
of Jacob's first marriage, from the series of the
tribes. Tradition places him among the oldest sons,
between Simeon and Judah. But the tribes deduced
from this ancestor won no territory like the rest:
they were scattered among the other tribes. We may
assume that the priestly families, who from antiquity
had discharged the sacred duty at the main seats of
worship, the race of Kohath (to which belonged the
sons of Aaron), with the priestly families of the other
altars (the races of Gershom and Merari), and the
families of the temple-servants connected with them,
were not combined into a tribe till a late period. The
name "Levi" may mean "bound," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> bound to a
shrine, and hence a temple-servant. The separation
of this tribe from the rest, and its dedication to the
sacred service, is brought forward with great emphasis
in the first text, which was composed from the point
of view of the priests. Jehovah takes the Levites in
the place of the first-born of Israel, and this same
text allots to the Levites forty-eight cities of Canaan
which they never possessed, and never inhabited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
either exclusively or in preponderant numbers.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> But
while in this text the adoption of the Levites by
Jehovah, and their "possession of the sacrifice" in the
place of a territory, is regarded and extolled as a
privilege of this tribe, we found above (<a href="#Page_439">p. 439</a>) that
an old poem spoke of the "division of the Levites in
Jacob and their scattering in Israel" as the punishment
of the sin which their progenitor had once
committed. Hence we must assume that the groups
of races, to which the foremost families of the priests
belonged, once formed a connected tribe like the rest,
and the breaking up of this tribe was brought about
after the settlement in Canaan by causes unknown
to us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE HEBREW INVASION OF CANAAN.</h3>


<p>When the Israelites had delivered themselves from
the dominion of Egypt, they pastured their flocks on
the peninsula of Sinai. Afterwards they wandered
further to the north-east into the Syrian desert, and
at length, as the oases in this district were few, and
the wells insufficient, they threw themselves upon the
rich uplands on the east of the Jordan. From the
table-land, which they had conquered, they saw before
them the happy valley of the Jordan, the fig-trees
and pomegranates, the vines and green glades in the
valleys beyond it. The sight roused the greater
portion of the Israelites to descend into the valley,
and invade the land beyond the river, in order to win
settled abodes where milk and honey were said to
flow.</p>

<p>We have already examined the circumstances of
Canaan. The Amorites had destroyed the power of
the Hittites; and in conjunction with the remnants
of the Hittites and Hivites, they possessed the land.
They lived separately in the various mountain cantons,
under small princes from thirty to forty in number.
But their cities were old and well fortified; the
nature of the land was in favour of defence, and on
the coasts lay the strong cities of the Phenicians and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
the Philistines. It was no light undertaking. The
Israelites had left Egypt a nation of peaceful shepherds,
but the sixty or seventy years which they subsequently
passed in the desert, and on the uplands
beyond the Jordan, had hardened them and made
them into warriors. The successes which they gained
against the Amalekites, the Amorites of Heshbon, and
Bashan must have roused their courage. If they combined
in an attack on the isolated cantons of Canaan,
they might hope to become masters even of the fortified
walls, and perhaps they even found assistance
among the Hittites and Hivites, who lived under the
oppressive rule of the Amorites. About the middle
of the thirteenth century <small>B.C.</small>, the greater part of the
Israelites marched towards the Jordan. Joshua, the
prince of the tribe of Ephraim, led the army. The
tribes of Reuben and Gad, and a part of the tribe of
Manasseh, remained behind on the other side of the
Jordan.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>The book of Joshua gives the following account of
the conquest of Canaan by the Hebrews: It came to
pass after the death of Moses, that Jehovah spoke to
Joshua the son of Nun: Up, cross over Jordan, thou
and all the people, into a land which I will give thee.
Then Joshua commanded the leaders of the people:
Go through the camp and say, Make ready your pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>visions;
in three days ye shall cross the Jordan. When
the people set out from their tents at Shittim, and
reached the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark
before them, and the feet of the priests, who carried
the ark, touched the water of Jordan, the water which
flowed from above stood up, and the water which flowed
downwards to the Dead Sea parted from the upper
water, till the ark of Jehovah and the people of Israel
had passed over on dry land. And the people encamped
at Gilgal, on the tenth day of the first month,
and Joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the
children of Israel, the whole nation that was born in
the desert, and kept the passover on the fourteenth
day of the month at evening in the plain of Jericho.
And Jehovah said to Joshua: See, I have given
Jericho and her king into thy hand. Go round the
city for six days, and let seven priests carry seven
trumpets before the ark, and on the seventh day ye
shall go round the city seven times, and the priests
shall blow upon the trumpets. And when ye hear
the sound of the trumpets, all the people shall make
a great cry, and the walls of the city will fall down,
and the people shall pass over them, every man straight
before him. Joshua fulfilled the command of Jehovah,
and when the people marched round the walls of
Jericho for the seventh time on the seventh day,
Joshua said: Cry aloud, for Jehovah has given the
city to you, and it shall be sacred, it and all that is
in it, to Jehovah, and all the silver and gold, and
all the vessels of copper and iron shall belong to
Jehovah, and shall go into his treasury. When the
people heard the sound of the trumpets, they made a
great cry, and the walls fell down, and the people
went up into the city and took it. And they set
apart all that was in the city from the man to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
woman, from the boy to the old man, from the oxen
to the sheep, and slew them with the edge of the
sword.</p>

<p>Then Joshua sent spies to Ai. When they returned
they said to Joshua: Let not the whole people go up;
two or three thousand men can smite Ai, for they are
few. Joshua sent three thousand, but the men of Ai
overcame them, and pursued them as far as Shebarim,
and smote them on the slope of the mountain. Then
Joshua rent his garments and fell upon his face. But
Jehovah said to him: Israel has taken of the forbidden
spoil; the children of Israel cannot stand before their
enemies, if that which is forbidden is not destroyed
from their midst. They must come forth according
to their tribes, races, and houses, and the house,
which Jehovah shall choose, shall come forward man
by man. And whoever shall be found with that
which is forbidden, shall be burnt with fire and all
that belongs to him. Joshua caused Israel to come
forward, according to their tribes, and the lot fell on
the tribe of Judah, and race of Serah; and in the
race of Serah the lot fell upon the house of Sabdi,
and of the men of the house of Sabdi the lot fell upon
Achan, the son of Charmi. Then Achan confessed
that he had taken a beautiful mantle of Shinar, and
200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold fifty shekels in
weight, and had hidden them in his tent. And
Achan the son of Charmi was led out "with his sons
and daughters, his oxen and asses, his tent and all
that he had, and all Israel stoned them, and they
burnt them with fire, and covered them with stones,
and then erected there a great heap of stones." But
Joshua set out towards Ai, with all the people, and
chose 5,000 men of war, and sent them out in the
night, and said to them: Go ye and lie in ambush at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
the back of the city, between Ai and Bethel. I and
all the people that is with me will draw near towards
the city, and if they come out to meet us, we will fly
before them. Then be ye ready and rise up out of
your ambush and set fire to the city. When Israel
went forth towards Ai, the king of Ai came to meet
them for battle; but Joshua turned with his people
and fled, and all the people of Ai pursued them, and
left the city open. Then the men in ambush rose,
and set fire to the town; and when the men of Ai
looked behind them, the smoke of their houses rose to
heaven; and Israel turned upon their pursuers and
slew the men of Ai, who were between the Israelites
on this side, and the Israelites on that side, so that
none remained beside the king whom they took alive.
Afterwards the women and children in Ai were put
to the sword, and of the slain on this day there were
12,000. And Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a
tree till evening. Then they took the corpse down
from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate,
and erected over it a great heap of stones till this
day: but the city remained a heap of desolation.</p>

<p>When the men of Gibeon&mdash;a great city like one of
the king's cities, it was greater than Ai, and all the inhabitants
were men of war&mdash;and the men of Chephirah,
Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim, heard what Joshua had
done, they sent to him, and the messengers put old
shoes and clouted on their feet, and old clothes on
their bodies, and took old sacks on their asses, and
patched wine skins, and the bread of their provisions
was old and mouldy. Thus they came into the camp
of Israel at Gilgal, and said to Joshua: We are
come from a far country to make a covenant with
thee; behold, the wine skins are torn which we filled
new, our bread is dry and mouldy, our clothes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
our shoes are old by reason of the length of the way.
And Joshua made a covenant with them to let them
live, and the princes of the people made an oath with
them. But when the children of Israel set forth from
Gilgal, they came on the third day to their cities.
Then Joshua called them and said: Why have ye
deceived us and said, we are far from you. Be ye now
accursed, and may ye never cease to be servants, and
drawers of water, and hewers of wood for the house
of my God. Thus he did to them, and saved them
from the hand of the children of Israel that they slew
them not.</p>

<p>Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, heard what Joshua
had done to Jericho and her king, and to Ai and her
king, and that Gibeon had made peace with Joshua.
He sent to Hoham, king of Hebron; and to Piram,
king of Jarmuth; and to Japhia, king of Lachish;
and to Debir, king of Eglon, and they gathered
themselves and went forth, five kings of the Amorites,
and encamped against Gibeon. Then Joshua set forth
from Gilgal, and all the men of war with him. And
Jehovah caused the Amorites to flee before the children
of Israel, and Joshua cried: Sun, stand thou still
upon Gibeon, and thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
And the sun stood still, and the moon waned not, till
the people took vengeance on their enemies, and before
this was no day like it, nor after it. And the five
kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah;
and when it was told to Joshua, that the kings
were hidden there, he said: Roll great stones before
the cave, and set men there to watch it. But do ye
halt not, but pursue your enemies, and smite the rear
guard, and let them not come into the cities. And
Israel accomplished the slaughter, and turned back
to the camp at Makkedah. And Joshua caused the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
five kings to come forth out of the cave, and called to
the leaders of his warriors and said: Come forward
and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And
when this had been done, Joshua smote the kings, and
hanged them on five trees, and they hung on the trees
till evening. Then Joshua commanded to take them
down, and they cast them into the cave, and laid
great stones on the mouth of the cave till this day.</p>

<p>Then Joshua took Makkedah, and Libnah, and
Lachish, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
and let no fugitive escape in Makkedah, Libnah, and
Lachish; and did to the kings of Makkedah and
Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Horam, king of Gezer, went out to help Lachish,
but Joshua defeated him and went from Lachish
against Eglon, and from Hebron against Debir; and
he set apart Eglon, and Hebron, and Debir, all the
souls that were therein, and smote the kings of
Hebron and Debir with the edge of the sword, and
returned to the camp at Gilgal.</p>

<p>But Jabin, king of Hazor, gathered together the
kings of Madon, Shimron, and Achshaph, and the kings
of the north, who dwell towards the midnight, on the
mountain and in the plain, and they encamped a
great nation as the sands on the shore of the sea
in multitude, with chariots and horses on Lake Merom.
Then Joshua with all his men of war fell upon them
suddenly, and smote them, and pursued them as
far as Sidon, and to the valley of Mizpeh, and lamed
their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
Then he took Hazor, the chief city of all these kingdoms,
and smote their king with the sword, and all
the souls that were therein; and all the booty of these
cities, and all the cattle, the Israelites took for spoil.
For a long time Joshua made war with all these kings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
and he expelled the Anakites from the mountains of
Hebron, from Debir and Anab, from the mountain of
Judah and the mountain of Israel; with their cities
he destroyed them. And there was no city which
surrendered peacefully to the Hebrews except that of
the Hivites of Gibeon.</p>

<p>Joshua was old and stricken in years, and Jehovah
said to him: Divide this land among the nine tribes
and the half-tribe of Manasseh. And Eleazar the
priest and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chiefs
of the tribes of the children of Israel divided the
land by lot. And the lot of the children of Judah
was in the south, as far as the wilderness of Sin and
the brook of Egypt, and in the east as far as the
Dead Sea and to the end of Jordan, and in the north
the border was Gilgal and the valley of Ben Hinnom,
and Beth Shemesh, and the western border was the
Great Sea. And the lot came forth for the children
of Joseph, and their borders on the south ran from
the water of Jericho over toward Bethhoron, and
from Bethhoron toward the sea. The land toward
the south fell to Ephraim, and the land toward
the north to Manasseh. And the whole community
of the children of Israel were gathered together
at Shiloh, and there they set up the holy tent, and
Joshua spake to the seven tribes, whose possessions
were not yet allotted: Choose three men out of each
tribe to write down the land, for I will cast lots for
you here at Shiloh before Jehovah. And so the men
went and wrote down the land according to the cities,
in seven parts, and Joshua cast lots at Shiloh, and
divided the land to the children of Israel according
to their divisions. But Jehovah commanded Joshua
that he should speak to the children of Israel, and tell
them to fix the cities of refuge, to which the homicide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
was to fly who slew a man in misadventure, in order
that the elders of the city might receive him, and if
the avenger pursued him, they were not to deliver
him into his hand till he had been brought before
the people. And they consecrated Kadesh, and
Shechem, and Hebron, and Bezer, and Ramoth in
Gilead, and Golan. And the chiefs of the tribe of
the Levites went to Eleazar the priest and Joshua
the son of Nun, and asked for cities to dwell in,
and land for their cattle; and the Israelites gave
them forty-eight cities and their land for their
possession. And Joshua gathered the elders of
Israel, and his leaders and judges, and gave law
and justice at Shechem; and he died one hundred
and ten years old, and they buried him in the land
of his possession at Timnath-serah, on the mountain
of Israel; and the bones of Joseph, which the children
of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried at
Shechem, on the piece of the field which Jacob bought
(pp. <a href="#Page_411">411</a>, <a href="#Page_418">418</a>), and the children of Joseph kept the
place for a possession. And Eleazar, the son of Aaron,
died, and they buried him in Gibeah, the city of
Phinehas, his son, which was given to him on the
mountain of Ephraim.</p>

<p>The conception of the covenant between Jehovah
and Israel, and of the arrangement of law, as it
existed in complete perfection in later times, dominates
the two texts of the Pentateuch and the
book of Joshua, no less than the prophetic revision
of these texts (<a href="#Page_386">p. 386</a>), and could not but exercise
an influence on the narrative of the conquest of
Canaan, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the fulfilment of the prophecies. Even
in the first text it is the direct command of Jehovah
which leads Joshua to set out towards the Jordan;
and it is the priestly ideas of this text which come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
out strongly in the feast of the passover and the
circumcision before the conquest of Jericho. The
miraculous passage of the Jordan is a repetition of
the passage through the reed-sea. This narrative
belongs, as it seems, to the second text, and is further
amplified by the reviser.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> The overthrow of the walls
of Jericho, when the priests had blown their trumpets
and the people raised the war-cry, is briefly narrated
in the first text; here also the details are the work
of the reviser. If the walls of Jericho were mounted
at the first onset, tradition might well recount the
story that they were broken down before the war-cry
of Israel; and from this the farther account could
be framed. The law of the priests ordained: "All
that is devoted (<i>cherem</i>), what every man dedicates
to Jehovah from all that is his, from men, or cattle,
or the field of his possession, that cannot be bought
or redeemed. All that is devoted is holy to
Jehovah."<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Joshua had devoted Jericho and all that
was in the city to Jehovah. But one of the nation
had taken something for himself from this devoted
spoil. The punishment comes upon the whole people,
and the first attempt on Ai is a failure. The more
complete is the victory when that transgressor and
his house is stoned to death. By this narrative the
observance of the command was deeply impressed on
all. When it was found long after the settlement
in Canaan what pernicious results for life, morals,
and religious worship followed from the fact that
portions of the old population were allowed to remain
among them, it appeared to the priestly mind that
the due regulation and purity of the Hebrew nature
required the extinction of the earlier inhabitants, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
even before they took possession of Canaan, Jehovah
must have given the command to make neither covenant
nor marriage with the Canaanites, to destroy
their altars and images, and to extirpate the nation.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
Without doubt, at the time of the conquest a considerable
number of the old population were not
only driven out, but were put to death; and it is
certain that when cities were taken by storm their
inhabitants "from man to woman, from child to
old man," were slain with the edge of the sword;
but a systematic extirpation did not take place. Of
the four cities of the Hivites&mdash;Gibeon, Chephirah,
Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim&mdash;Gibeon, two good hours
north-west of Jebus, was the most important. These
four cities joined the Hebrews against the ruling
Amorites,<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> and combined with them.  The craft of
the Gibeonites, by which they succeeded in deceiving
Joshua about their Canaanitic descent, is intended to
explain the sparing of such an important part of the
old population in opposition to the pre-dated command
of extirpation. And if to this is added the fact that
Joshua, when he had once sworn to grant their lives,
made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for
the whole community, this, no doubt, rests on the fact
that at a later time king Saul, "in his zeal for Israel,"
intended to extirpate all the Gibeonites, and did
extirpate part, "though Israel had sworn to them;"
that David favoured them, but Solomon made "all
that was left of the Amorites, Jebusites, Hittites,
Perizzites, and Hivites bond-servants to this day."<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
The king Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem, who, startled
by the fall of Jericho and Ai, and "the peace which
Gibeon had made with Joshua," brings about the
league of the Amorite princes in the south against
the invasion of the Hebrews, belongs to the prophetic
revision; in the first text the Jerusalem of later times
is still the city of the Jebusites. The description of
the great battle and of the miracle at Gibeon against
the Amorites belongs to the second text. The miracle
is founded merely on the poetical expression in the
Israelite song of victory, "the sun stood still and
the moon stayed till the people had punished their
enemies," which meant no more than that the day
had been long enough, and the moon had shone long
enough, to allow them to achieve a great defeat of
the Amorites, and to pursue them a considerable
distance.  After this day Joshua is said to have
taken Hebron, Debir, Libnah, and Lachish, to have
conquered the kings of Northern Canaan in a great
battle, and to have gained their cities, including
Hazor.  This narrative with its particulars, according
to which the conquest of Canaan took place
in consequence of the battle of Gibeon and a second
great victory of the Israelites at Lake Merom, belongs
to the revision,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> and is open to serious difficulties.
In the first place we are told that Joshua, for a long
time, had fought against all the kings; but Hazor,
the abode of Jabin, which Joshua had attacked, we
find shortly after as again the abode of Jabin. A
large number of places which Joshua is said to have
taken are subsequently not in the hands of Israel,
and both in the Book of Joshua and the Book of
Judges mention is made of separate battles of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
tribes among which the battle about Hebron, which
the tribe of Judah obtained, is the most conspicuous.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>It was the view of both texts that the whole land
was promised and plighted to the Hebrews. They
did not dwell on particulars in order to bring out
more definitely and clearly the community of the
tribes, the divinely-arranged and righteous division
of the land among them. After the war, in the traditional
account, had continued about five years,
and Joshua was eighty-five years old, he and Eleazar,
the son of Aaron, divide by lot the territory gained
on this side of the Jordan. The first text here defines
the portion of the tribe of Judah with special minuteness,
the second dwells upon the importance of the
tribe of Ephraim. Last of all, the forty-eight cities,
on an average four in each tribe, were set apart for
the Levites. Of these forty-eight thirteen are mentioned
as allotted to the families of the priests of
the tribe of Levi. These lie entirely in the territory
of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, while the ark of
the covenant evidently was placed at Shiloh in the
territory of Ephraim. In the neighbourhood of this
sanctuary, therefore, the priests must have had their
dwellings. On the other hand, Nob, which in Saul's
time was called a city of the priests,<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> was not among
these thirteen cities. And among the thirty-five
cities which are said to have been given to the
Levite ministers, several are found which were not
conquered by the Israelites, such as Taanach, Gezer,
Jibleam, and Nahalal. Of the thirteen towns of the
priests and the six cities of refuge, which were partly
cities of the priests and partly of the temple-servants,
Hebron, the first-mentioned, was, as has been already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
remarked, conquered later on, and not by Joshua.
These arrangements have arisen out of ideals; there
never were Levite cities in Israel, and the right of
asylum in the cities of refuge was not recognised till a
later time. Even if we set aside the sacerdotal scheme
for the distribution of the land, we cannot repose complete
confidence in an apparently ancient enumeration
of the conquered kings and cities given in the Book of
Joshua. Allowing that it belonged to one of the two
original texts, it has been altered and interpolated.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
Cities are mentioned as conquered which are not mentioned
in the preceding narrative; others are quoted as
subjugated which evidently remained long after in the
hand of the Canaanites, like Taanach and Megiddo.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>Adopting, therefore, as our principal basis the
accounts which are in existence about the battles of
the various tribes, we shall have to assume that the
course of affairs was somewhat of this kind. The
two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the greater part of
the tribe of Manasseh preferred to remain on the east
of the Jordan. The fertile depression round Jericho
naturally formed the first object of attack. Jericho was
taken. But the destruction of the city can hardly
have been completely carried out; for not very long
after we find it again inhabited.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> That the Hebrews
after taking Jericho established themselves at Gilgal,
and from this place undertook flying campaigns against
the cities of the Amorites, are statements which, as
to the fact, need not excite any doubts. The covenant
with the neighbouring four cities of the Hivites,
which was appealed to even in the time of the
kings, proves evidently that these cities united with
the Israelites and fought on their side against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
Amorites. In order to defend Gibeon against the
Amorites, who wished to punish their defection, the
great battle against the Amorites took place near this
city, which is proved to be a fact by the old song of
victory. By this overthrow the power of the Amorites
seems to have been broken. Their defence henceforth
is confined to each of the cities maintaining itself. But
the attacking party also lost their unity. The various
tribes of the Israelites attempted to conquer the districts
which pleased them; and the campaign of conquest
broke up into local conflicts. The tribe of Ephraim,
accompanied by the greater part of the remaining
tribes, turned northwards to the green heights and
shady valleys of Shiloh and Shechem. Here, on "the
mountain of Ephraim," the Ephraimites settled;
the sacred ark was placed at Shiloh, and here at
Timnath-Serah, "which he had sought from the
people and had obtained," Joshua took up his abode,
and built the city and dwelt therein. Round the
fortress of the prince the best part of the tribe
must have settled. On the same mountains lay the
portion of land which belonged to the priest of the
sacred ark, Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Near a
sanctuary at Shechem, under the oak, the priests and
elders of the tribe assembled for the administration of
law and justice. The Ephraimitic text represents the
sons of Joseph as saying to Joshua that they were a
numerous people, and that Mount Ephraim was too
narrow for them. Joshua replied, Go up to the forest,
and hew out for yourselves there in the land of the
Perizzites and Rephaims, if Mount Ephraim is too
narrow for you. They answered: The mountain will
not be gained by us; there are iron chariots among all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley at
Beth-shean, and in the valley of Jezreel. But Joshua
said: The mountain shall belong to thee. It is forest,
hew it down, and the outgoings shall belong to thee.
Thou shalt drive out the Canaanites.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>The tribes of Judah and Simeon turned to the south
after the battle of Gibeon, and settled in the mountain
land of Hebron; here they succeeded in acquiring a
considerable territory. But it was only by slow
degrees, through long and severe battles, that the two
tribes advanced. The tribe of Judah first overcame
the king of Bezek, and took him prisoner. From the
king as from the rest of the prisoners the thumbs and
the great toes were cut off. Then the king of Bezek
said: Three score and ten kings having their thumbs
and their great toes cut off gathered what fell from
my table; now I have been requited.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Of more importance
was it that Caleb the son of Jephunneh
established himself in Hebron, the old metropolis of
the land of the south (<a href="#Page_346">p. 346</a>), and independently subjugated
the surrounding territory.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> To the man who
should conquer Debir he promised his daughter
Achsah to wife, and Othniel his brother's son gained
the city and the woman. From Debir the tribe of
Judah pressed on to the south, and conquered Zephath
and Hormah. "And Jehovah"&mdash;so we find it in the
Book of Judges&mdash;"was with Judah, and he took the
mountain and possessed it, but could not drive out the
inhabitants of the low ground because they had chariots
of iron."<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> The inhabitants of the low ground are the
Philistines on the coast, whose power was undoubtedly
superior to that of the tribes of Judah and Simeon.
The Simeonites, a tribe by no means numerous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
settled themselves under the tribe of Judah, and had
to be content with the least fertile districts on the
southern border.</p>

<p>The tribe of Manasseh, so nearly related to Ephraim,
had in part remained beyond the Jordan; the other
part settled under the Ephraimites, on their northern
border in the region from Hadad Rimmon to the
mouth of the Kishon, but they were unable to gain
the mastery over the greater number of the cities of
the Canaanites situated in this district. The little
tribe of Benjamin had settled round Gibeon, perhaps
immediately after the battle, between Bethhoron and
Jericho, on the southern border of Ephraim. The
tribes of Issachar and Zebulon, Asher and Naphtali
were the last to acquire settled abodes. Issachar conquered
the heights of Tirzah and Gilboa, as far as
Tabor; Zebulon planted himself between the right
bank of the Kishon and the lake of Kinneroth, in the
region of Jokneam and Beth Arbel. Westward of the
lakes of Kinneroth and Merom lay the tribes of Naphtali
and Asher; the first was nearest to the lake of
Merom, in the district of the northern Kadesh; Asher
was further to the west, on the borders of the land of
Tyre. The tribe of Dan attempted to gain the spurs
of the mountain westward of Benjamin towards the
sea. For a long time it encamped against the Amorites
and the northern cities of the Philistines, Ekron
and Gath, but though occasionally supported by
Ephraim and Judah, it never gained territory enough
for its numbers. When the others had long been
fixed in settled abodes, a part of the Danites, finding it
impossible to advance to the coast, set out to the north,
and took the city of Laish, northward of Kadesh and
the land of Naphtali, which belonged to the Sidonians,<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
gave it the name of Dan, and here, as they had become
more warlike than the rest, owing to their prolonged
battles, maintained the northernmost point of the
land of Israel.</p>

<p>The conquest was completed. In the middle of the
thirteenth century <small>B.C.</small> the Israelites had broken the
power of the Amorites in Canaan, and gained a considerable
territory (about 10,000 square miles), of which
one-half lay on the nearer and the other on the farther
side of the Jordan. But this land, divided by the
Jordan, was neither a whole united from within, nor
protected by natural boundaries from without. As
the Israelites immediately after their first successes
became again disunited, and the attack became less
powerful at every step in advance, the Canaanites
maintained themselves in independence, in separate
valleys or heights difficult of approach, and in strong
fortresses. Remnants of the Canaanites remained
everywhere among and between the Israelites. Beside
the Benjamites the Jebusites (a tribe of the Amorites)
maintained themselves, and at Gibeon, Kirjath-jearim,
Chephirah, and Beeroth were the Hivites, who had
made peace with the Israelites. In the land of
Ephraim the Canaanites held their ground at Gezer
and Bethel, until the latter&mdash;it was an important
city&mdash;was stormed by the Ephraimites.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Among
the tribe of Manasseh the Canaanites were settled
at Beth Shean, Dan, Taanach, Jibleam, Megiddo
and their districts,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> and in the northern tribes the
Canaanites were still more numerous. It was not till
long after the immigration of the Hebrews that they
were made in part tributary.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> The land of the Israelites
beyond the Jordan, where the tribe of Manasseh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
possessed the north, Gad the centre, and Reuben the
south as far as the Arnon, was exposed to the attacks
of the Ammonites and Moabites, and the migratory
tribes of the Syrian desert, and must have had the
greater attraction for them, as better pastures were
to be found in the heights of Gilead, and the valleys
there were more fruitful. To the west only the tribe
of Ephraim reached the sea, and became master of a
harbourless strip of coast. The remaining part of the
coast and all the harbours remained in the hands of
the powerful cities of the Philistines and the Phenicians.
No attempt was made to conquer these,
although border-conflicts took place between the tribes
of Judah, Dan, and Asher, and Philistines and Sidonians.
Such an attempt could only have been made
if the Israelites had remained united, and even then
the powers of the Israelites would hardly have sufficed
to overthrow the walls of Gaza, Ascalon, and Ashdod,
of Tyre, Sidon, and Byblus. Yet the invasion of the
Israelites was not without results for the cities of the
coast: it forced a large part of the population to
assemble in them, and we shall see below how rapid
and powerful is the growth of the strength and importance
of Tyre in the time immediately following
the incursion of the Israelites, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> immediately after
the middle of the thirteenth century. As the population
and in consequence the power of the cities on
the coast increased, owing to the collection of the
ancient population on the shore of the sea, those
cities became all the more dangerous neighbours for
the Israelites.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune for the new territory which the
Israelites had won by the sword that it was without
the protection of natural boundaries on the north and
east, that the cities of the Philistines and Phenicians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
barred it towards the sea, and in the interior remnants
of the Canaanites still maintained their place. Yet
it was a far more serious danger for the immigrants
that they were without unity, connection, or guidance,
for they had already given up these before
the conflict was ended. Undoubtedly a vigorous
leadership in the war of conquest against the
Canaanites might have established a military
monarchy which would have provided better for the
maintenance of the borders and the security of the land
than was done in its absence. But the isolated defence
made by the Canaanites permitted the attacking
party also to isolate themselves. The new masters of
the land lived, like the Canaanites before and among
them, in separate cantons; the mountain land which
they possessed was much broken up, and without any
natural centre, and though there were dangerous
neighbours, there was no single concentrated aggressive
power in the neighbourhood, now that Egypt
remained in her borders. The cities of the Philistines
formed a federation merely, though a federation far
more strongly organised than the tribes of the
Israelites. Under these circumstances political unity
was not an immediately pressing question among the
Israelites; but owing to the dispersion in which they
lived, and the open borders of their new kingdom, the
question seriously arose whether they could enjoy in
peace the land they had won. Whatever the weight
with which the want of internal concentration and
external repulsion might be felt, whatever the difficulties
arising from the remnant of Canaanites left in
the land, and however unsatisfactory the maintenance
of the borders of the land, these political drawbacks
were only so many advantages for the development
of the religious and moral life of the Israelites.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE NATIONS OF ASIA MINOR.</h3>


<p>The peninsula of Asia Minor is a table-land of
about 750 miles in length by 400 in breadth, lying
between the Black Sea, the &AElig;gean, and the Mediterranean.
This table-land reaches its highest level
in the south; here run along the Mediterranean,
from east to west, parallel ranges of mountains, the
chain of Taurus, and under the snow-clad heights lie
green Alpine pastures, while the slopes are filled
with the most beautiful wood. Under these mountains
on the sea we find here and there narrow and
hot but fruitful plains, which are separated into
several sharply-divided districts by the spurs of the
Taurus, which run athwart them into the sea. Northward
of the peaks of Taurus the soil gradually sinks
to the Black Sea, so that while the southern coast
possesses only short streams, with the exception of
the Sarus and Pyramus, the larger arteries of the land
empty into the Black Sea&mdash;the Iris, the Halys, the
Bill&aelig;us, the Sangarius, and the Rhyndakus. These
rivers take their course, partly through rocky districts,
partly through extremely fruitful valleys. The centre
of the land, from the middle course of the Halys to
the Sangarius in the west, is taken up with a wide
treeless desert, the great Salt-steppe, the edges of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
which are formed by a mass of volcanic craters, by
deep ravines and large lakes. Further to the west
the waters streaming from the table-land find their
way to the &AElig;gean, down a series of mountain terraces,
so that the valleys of the M&aelig;ander and the Hermus
are at the same time the highways which connect the
coast with the interior. These terraces sometimes
advance to the western shore, with steep limestone
rocks and precipitous promontories running out into
the bright blue sea; at other times they approach the
coast with softer outlines; in one place broader, in
others narrower plains are left, which, owing to the
great fertility of the soil, are covered with orchards
and vineyards. Further inland, on the rising heights,
is a splendid forest of oaks, firs, and planes, broken by
mountain pastures, over which rise the jagged rocks
of Ida, Tmolus, Messogis, and Latmus; in the far
distance the snow-capped peaks of Taurus fill the
horizon. On the western coast the proximity of the
ocean softens the heat of summer and the cold of
winter; and the combination of sea and mountain, of
ocean breezes and upland air, the connection opened
to the table-land on the east by the Hermus and
M&aelig;ander and the calm sea on the west, which forms
a passage to a number of adjacent islands&mdash;make these
districts on the shore of the &AElig;gean Sea the favoured
home of civilisation in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>On the north-east, where the peninsula joins the
broad mountain land of the isthmus between the
Black Sea and the Caspian, around the sources of the
Euphrates and Tigris, on the course of the Araxes,
which falls into the Caspian Sea, and the high table-land
of Lake Van, lay the home of the Armenians.
According to Strabo, their customs were like those of
the Medes, who were the neighbours of the Armenians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
to the east of the Lake of Urumiah, and at the mouth
of the Araxes. And if, according to the same evidence,
the Armenians paid the greatest reverence to
the goddess Anaitis,<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> the goddess Anahita held a
prominent position in the worship of the nations of
the table-land of Iran. Moreover, even in modern
Armenian, the affinity with the Iranian languages is
predominant; and there is therefore no doubt that
the Armenians belong to the Indo-Germanic stock,
and are a nation of Aryan descent.</p>

<p>On the southern slope of the group of mountains
which they possessed south-east of the Lake of Van, on
the upper course of the Great Zab, lay the district
of Arphaxad, with which we have already become
acquainted from Semitic sources; south of the lake lay
the Carduchi, whom the later Greeks call the Gordy&aelig;ans
and Gordyenes; but among the Armenians
they were known as Kordu, among the Syrians as
Kardu.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> These are the ancestors of the modern
Kurds, a nation also of the Aryan stock, whose
language is even nearer to those of Iran than the
Armenian. Westward of the Carduchi, at the confluence
of the two streams of the Euphrates, we again
meet with a Semitic race.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The north-western slope
of the Armenian mountains, as far as the Phasis and
the Black Sea, was the home of the Muskai of the
Assyrian inscriptions, the Mesech of the Hebrews, the
Moschi of the Greeks. Beside them, further to the
west, on the coast, were the Tabal of the Assyrians,
the Tubal of the Hebrews, the Tibarenes of the
Greeks; westward from these, as far as the mouth
of the Iris, were the Chalti of the Armenians, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
Chalybians (Chald&aelig;ans) of the Greeks. Of the origin
and language of the Moschi and Tibarenes we know
nothing further; the genealogies of the Hebrews
placed Mesech and Tubal among the sons of Japhet.</p>

<p>The territory of the Armenians round Lake Van
lies 5,000 feet high. The only extensive plain
among the mountains which are the home of the
Armenians is the valley on the middle course of the
Araxes, which is separated from the district of the
Van by the range of the Masis (Ararat). The highest
peak of this range, a mighty cone of dark rock, veiled
by wide glaciers, rises to a height of 16,000 feet.
Only the valley of the Araxes allowed agriculture on
any extensive scale; it only brought forth abundant
produce. Other more protected and warmer depressions,
though small in extent, on the southern slopes,
permitted the culture of the vine. The inhabitants of
the heights followed a pastoral life, and the mountain
pastures supported splendid horses and mules.</p>

<p>Moses of Chorni (Khorene), who wrote the history
of Armenia in the years 460-480 of our era,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> tells
us as follows:&mdash;Japhet, the third son of Noah, had
a son Gomer; Gomer's son was Thiras; Thiras had
a son Thorgom; Thorgom's son Haik, together with
his son Armenak and all his family, emigrated
from Babylon to the plain of Airarat, in order to
escape the tyranny of Belus, the king of Babel. This
plain Haik then left to Cadmus, his grandson, the son
of Armenak, and himself, with Armenak, passed on to
the west, and founded Haikashen. But when the
army of the Babylonians marched out to attack
Airarat, Haik came to the assistance of his grandson,
and defeated Belus on the shore of Lake Van. Then
Armenak marched eastwards from Haikashen into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
plain at the foot of the Aragazd, where at a later time
Armajis, the son of Armenak, built the city of
Armavir. The son of Armajis was Amasiaj, and of
Amasiaj, Arast. The grandson of Arast was Aram,
who undertook distant campaigns, and subjugated
Syria and Cappadocia to his rule. With him Ninus,
king of Assyria, out of respect to his power and
bravery, made a league. Aram's son and successor was
Araj, whose beauty inflamed Shamiram (Semiramis),
the queen of Assyria. When Araj resisted her
inclinations, Shamiram, at the head of her army,
invaded Armenia, but, before the battle, she bade her
soldiers spare Araj. The Armenians were defeated,
and in spite of the command of Shamiram, Araj was
slain in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, and she attempted in vain to
resuscitate the corpse by magic arts. Then Shamiram
caused builders to come from Assyria to Armenia, and
with the help of these she erected a splendid city,
Shamiramakert (city of Semiramis), on the shore of
the lake of Van, in order to dwell in the cool air of
the mountains during the heat of the summer months;
and the throne of Armenia she gave to Cardus, the
son of Araj.  But he rebelled against her, fought
without success, and, like his father, fell in battle.
At last the Medes rebelled against Shamiram, and
after defeat she fled to Armenia. On the shores of
Lake Van she was overtaken by her pursuers, and
when she had thrown her necklace and her ornaments
into the water, she was slain. Then her son Zames
(Ninyas) ascended the throne of Assyria, and for
twenty-six generations the descendants of Cardus
were vassals of the kings of Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> After these
twenty-six kings, whose names are given by Moses,

Mede, crowned Baroir king of Armenia, and his
descendants ruled as independent princes. The ninth
successor of Baroir was Tigran (Tigranes). He conquered
Azdahag (Astyages), the king of the Medes,
and pierced him through with his lance in the battle.
Owing to Tigran's bravery and victory, the prince of
the Persians became the lord of the Medes.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>We can trace the elements out of which this
account has arisen. The names Japhet, Gomer, and
Thiras are borrowed from the Hebrew scriptures, from
the genealogy of the Japhetic nations in Genesis;
but the order of succession is altered. To the same
book belongs Thorgom, the son of Thiras, and father
of Haik; in the Hebrew his name is Torgarmah.
Torgarmah was the name of Armenia among the
Syrians;<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> the Hebrews appear to have used the word
to denote the district of Van. The native name of the
Armenians was Haikh, and of the land, Haiastan.
From these names is derived Haik, the son of
Thorgom, the progenitor of the race. The emigration
from Babylon is no doubt an invention arising out of
some early contact, out of the trade of Armenia with
Babylonia, and intended to give the Armenians a
share in the splendour of that ancient centre of the
civilisation of Hither Asia, from which, as a fact, they
derived such important elements of culture as their
system of writing.  Eastward of Lake Van Haik
defeats the Babylonians, for here lay Haik's fortress;
in Armenian Haikabjerd, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> fortress of the Armenians,
and Hajots-dsor, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> valley of the Armenians. Northeast
of this lake lies the canton of Harkth, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
fathers, the canton of the fathers;<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> and in this, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
the Eastern Euphrates, is Haikashen, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Haik's
building, which Haik is said to have founded, and
where his grave was reported to be. As the name of
Haik, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the name of the nation, clings especially to
the neighbourhood of Lake Van, so are the names of
his supposed successors, his son Armenak, and grandsons
Cadmos and Amajis, attached to the district of
Airarat, to Mount Aragadz, and the city of Armavir.
The land of Airarat, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the fruitful plain, on the
middle course of the Araxes, was, as we have heard,
the first object of the immigrants, who must have
come, not from the south, as the story represents, but
from the east, from Media, and must have reached the
valley of the Araxes from the shore of the Caspian Sea.
As Haikh is the name by which the Armenians called
themselves, so Armenak is obviously formed from the
name Armina, which the Medes and Persians gave
to the Armenians. Cadmus, the son of Armenak, is
inserted in the story; and has been borrowed, as
the form of the name shows, from Grecian sources,
perhaps to represent the Semitic population in the
South of Armenia. That in this learned construction
of the Armenian myth the eastern, and not the
southern, district of Armenia is given to Cadmus, is
due, no doubt, to the fact that the Semitic word
<i>kedem</i> could hardly have any other meaning than
that of "the East."  Armenak's grandson and great-grandson,
Amasiaj and Arast, represent respectively
the mountain chain of Masis and the river Araxes;
in old Armenian the name of the latter was Eras'ch.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>The division of the two centres of the Armenian
land and Armenian life&mdash;the land in the East and the
land in the West, the land of Ararat on the Araxes,
and the district of Van&mdash;is strongly marked in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
tradition, and not less so in the Assyrian inscriptions
and the scriptures of the Hebrews. The first text of
the Pentateuch represents Noah's ship as landing
on Mount Ararat, and this text or the second mentions
Togarmah beside Gomer. The prophet Ezekiel
speaks of the horses and mules which came from
Togarmah, the land of mountain pastures, to Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
The Assyrian inscriptions mention the land of Van
(<i>mat vannai</i>) beside the land of Urarti, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Ararat;
each is ruled by its own prince.</p>

<p>King Aram represents the land of Aram, the
Aram&aelig;ans, whose neighbours the Armenians were,
and with whom they came into frequent contact.
The oldest historical recollections of the Armenians
might perhaps go back to the times when the kings
of Assyria made an inroad into their mountains and
reduced their princes to tribute and obedience. But
when Moses of Chorni tells us of the meetings of
Aram, Araj, and Cardus with Ninus, Semiramis,
and Ninyas, of the twenty-six kings who governed
under Assyrian dominion, and of the liberation of
the land by Arbaces, these supposed names of the
Assyrian riders are enough to prove that the narratives
were framed upon the accounts of the Greeks,
especially the Greek chronographers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the story of the city of Semiramis
on Lake Van is grounded upon the Assyrian
images and ruins, which are still found in various
parts of Armenia, especially at Van, Bitlis, Karkar,
Egil, and Achlat, as also upon monuments of the
Persian kings, and Xerxes in particular; but no doubt
it is due in the greatest extent to the monuments
of the native princes, of whom inscriptions are in
existence belonging to the end of the seventh and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
sixth century <small>B.C.</small> Later historians knew nothing
of these princes, and were unable to read the inscriptions.
The long list of Armenian kings in Moses of
Chorni does not contain a single name of the Armenian
princes mentioned in the inscriptions of the
Assyrian kings, or in the native inscriptions of these
princes.</p>

<p>The narrative of king Tigran appears to be of an
earlier date than the rest of the material from which
Moses of Chorni compiled his history of Armenia
in the older period. Tigran is said to have ruled
over Armenia at the time of Cyrus, with whom he
entered into a league; he overcame Astyages (Azdahag)
of Media in battle, and slew him in single combat.
The first wife of Astyages and a number of his children,
together with other captives, Tigran then conducted
to Armenia, and there he settled them in the neighbourhood
of Koghten. In the songs of the people
of Koghten the descendants of Astyages are "allegorically"
spoken of as the descendants of the dragon,
"for Azdahag," Moses adds, "signifies a dragon in
our language."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> Hence it is clear that the Armenians
claimed the glory of having conquered the
Medes and overthrown their supremacy. And if
they called the descendants of Astyages the descendants
of the dragon, they obviously contracted the
old cloud-demon of the Avesta, Azhi-dahaka, into
Azdahag, and confounded him with Astyages. Xenophon
in his romance of Cyrus calls Tigranes the son
of the king of Armenia, and represents him as paying
the most considerable services to Cyrus. It may
have been the case that Xenophon in his march
through Armenia, when he crossed the snowclad
heights of this mountain region, and entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
mud huts of the mountaineers, and was hospitably
entertained by them with barley-wine, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> with beer,
heard the name and deeds of Tigranes.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>The kings of Assyria at an early period turned their
arms to the North. On the Zibene-su, the eastern
source of the Western Tigris, the likeness of Tiglath
Pilesar I. (1130-1110 <small>B.C.</small>) has been found engraved
on the rocks at Karkar. The inscription tells us that
he had overcome the land of Nairi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in all probability
the land of the rivers (Euphrates and Tigris),
and that he had defeated the Muskai (<a href="#Page_512">p. 512</a>), who
had not paid their tribute for fifty years, and had
invaded Kumukh (Commagene). More than 200
years later, Tiglath Adar II. (889 to 883 <small>B.C.</small>)
caused his image to be hewn in the rocks here beside
that of the first Tiglath Pilesar. Tiglath Adar's
successor, Assurnasirpal (883-859 <small>B.C.</small>), made repeated
campaigns against the Nairi, destroyed 250
of their towns, slew many of their princes, and set
up his image beside those of Tiglath Adar and
Tiglath Pilesar. In his tenth campaign he took
Amida (Diabekr) on the Tigris. Below this city,
at Kurkh, there is a second image of this king. His
successor also, Shalmanesar II. (859-823 <small>B.C.</small>), fought
against the Nairi, set up his image at the source of
the Tigris, and in the year 843 defeated the king of
Urarti. In the year 831 his troops again defeated
a king of Urarti, of another name than the first; in
the year 828 <small>B.C.</small> they laid waste the land of king
Udaki of Van, and in the following campaign fifty
places in Urarti were burnt. Bin Nirar III., king
of Asshur (810-781 <small>B.C.</small>), marched twice against
the district of Lake Van, and seven times against
the Nairi; he boasts that he has taken possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
of the land of the Nairi throughout its whole extent.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
Shalmanesar III. (781-771 <small>B.C.</small>) led his army six
times against Urarti. Then Tiglath Pilesar II.
(745-727 <small>B.C.</small>), in the year 742, defeated king
Sarda, or Sarduri, of Urarti, with his confederates;
in the year 728 <small>B.C.</small> removed Vassarmi from Tubal,
and placed Chulli on the throne in his stead.
In the time of Sargon of Assyria (722-705 <small>B.C.</small>),
Aza, the prince of the land of Van, who, like his
predecessor Iranzu, was a tributary to Assyria, was
murdered. His brother Ullusun, whom Sargon put
in his place, combined with Urza, prince of Ararat,
and the prince of Mount Mildis against Assyria.
Sargon was victorious; Ullusun submitted (716 <small>B.C.</small>);
but Urza maintained himself in Ararat, and although
Sargon boasts to have burnt fifty of his townships,
he combined with Urzana of Musasir, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> probably
of Arsissa on Lake Van, with Mita, prince of the
Moschi, with Ambris, prince of Tubal, the son of
Chulli, whom Sargon had allowed to succeed his
father on the throne of the Tibarenes, and to whom
at the same time he had entrusted the sovereignty
over Cilicia, and had given his daughter in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
The confederates were defeated; Ambris was carried
prisoner to Assyria, a part of his nation were transplanted
to Assyria, and Assyrians settled at Tubal
in his place. Mita submitted. Arsissa was captured;
20,000 prisoners, their treasures, the gods Haldia (?)
and Bagamazda (?), with the holy vessels, were
carried away. When Urza perceived this, he took
away his own life (714 <small>B.C.</small>).<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> In the seventh century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
Esarhaddon of Assyria had to fight against the
Cilicians, the Tibarenes, and the Mannai; the last
name seems to denote the Armenian district of
Minyas, on the upper course of the Eastern Euphrates,
of which the chief city was Manavazakert; Manavaz,
the son of Haik, is said to have built this city.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
Against the Mannai, or the Minni of Ezekiel, Esarhaddon's
successor, Assurbanipal (668-626 <small>B.C.</small>),
also directed his weapons. In the course of this
war Asheri, the prince of the Minni, was slain by
his own dependents, and his son Ualli submitted;
the previous tribute of the Minni was raised by thirty
horses; and Mugalla, king of Tubal, and Sandasarmi
of Cilicia voluntarily submitted to Assurbanipal.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>The mountains of Armenia, as these narratives
prove, were divided into several principalities. The
Assyrians first attacked the land to the south of
the high mountain-range, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, in the first instance
the land of Ararat, the most powerful of these
Armenian principalities. On either side of the
mountain, in the basin of Lake Van, and in the
valley of the Araxes, the Armenians made a vigorous
resistance, so that the obedience of the Armenian
chieftains never seemed to be secured for any length
of time. In spite of this resistance, the civilisation
of the Assyrians exercised great influence on the
Armenians. This is not merely shown in the
adoption of the system of cuneiform writing on the
part of the Armenians; Sargon caused the capture
of Arsissa to be represented in his palace at Khor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>sabad.
If these reliefs are true representations, the
style of architecture and the plan of the Armenian
temples were not essentially different from the Assyrian.
The altars also, the ornaments, and the weapons
appear to be similar.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> On the other hand it would
admit of no doubt that the Armenians, in spite of
this influence, retained the worship of their Iranian
gods without any foreign admixture, if the name of
that Armenian deity Bagamazda, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the great god,
were read correctly. That deity would at the same
time afford a new proof that the deities of Iran were
worshipped in Armenia also. Strabo, as already
(<a href="#Page_512">p. 512</a>) remarked, gives an account of the worship
of Anaitis, the water-giving goddess, the Anahita
of the Iranians, among the Armenians; and the name
of this goddess is found, in the form "Anaid," in the
cuneiform inscriptions of the Armenian princes.
Unfortunately these inscriptions, which mainly belong
to the land of Van, have not as yet been sufficiently
deciphered. The names of the kings, from which
they come, are read as Bagridur, Isbuinis, Minuas,
Argistis II. and Bagridur II.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> These kings reigned
successively; each calls himself the son of his predecessor.
An older Argistis of Ararat is mentioned
after the time of Urza in an inscription of Sargon,
king of Assyria, belonging apparently to the year
708 <small>B.C.</small> The inscriptions of the kings of Armenia
from the first to the second Bagridur are filled with
the wars which they carried on, the numbers of the
slain, of the captives, the cattle in the spoil, the
towns and temples destroyed. As Asshur is mentioned
in the inscriptions of Argistis II., and in those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
of his successor Bagridur II. a war against Babylon
is narrated,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> these two kings must have been contemporaries
of the last ruler of Assyria, Assuridilili
(626-606 <small>B.C.</small>), and Nebuchadnezzar II. of Babylon
(604-568 <small>B.C.</small>), and their three predecessors contemporaries
of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assurbanipal.</p>

<p>The central plain of the table-land of Asia Minor,
from the valley of the Halys and the great salt lake
to the Cadmus and the Mysian Olympus, north-westwards
as far as the coasts of the Propontis, was
inhabited by the Phrygians. According to Herodotus
the Thracians asserted that the Phrygians had once
dwelt in their land under the name of Briges. Hence
they had passed through Thrace to Asia, though a
part, who still preserved the name of Briges, had
remained behind in Thrace. Of those who arrived in
Asia, some passed still further to the east; and the
Armenians were colonists of the Phrygians.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> In
Strabo also the Phrygians are immigrants, and come
from Thrace.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> In any case the Bithynians, who were
settled on the lower course of the Sangarius from the
mouth of this stream westward as far as the Bosporus,
were of Thracian descent; they are said to have
emigrated from the Strymon to Asia.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> On the other
hand, the Phrygians themselves maintained that they
were not an offshoot from the Thracian Briges, but the
Briges in Thracia had emigrated from them.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> If the
affinity of the Armenians, the Phrygians, and Thracians
is established, the Phrygians must be considered in
the right. These migrations could not have pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>ceeded
from the Strymon, they must rather have
taken place from the east to the west, from Armenia
to Thrace, and the Thracians rather than the
Armenians were the last link in this emigration. As
the modern science of language finds Indo-Germanic
roots in the slight remains of the Phrygian language
which have come down to us,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> we must assume that
the progenitors of the Phrygians and Thracians passed
from the Armenian mountains in the east towards the
west. The ancestors of the Phrygians remained on
the table-land of Asia Minor, those of the Thracians
went further to the north-west, towards Bithynia, over
the Bosporus, which the Greeks named after the
Thracians; and beyond the strait they inhabited the
land under the Balkan from the Black Sea to the
shores of the Adriatic. The character of the language
of the Thracians and Illyrians, remains of which are
preserved in Rumanisch and Albanian, places it in
the Indo-Germanic family.</p>

<p>The Phrygians are said to have been a very ancient
nation.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> According to the accounts of the Greeks, the
legends of the Phrygians began the history of their
country with Gordius and Midas. Gordius, it was
said, was a poor farmer, who possessed only two yoke
of oxen. At that time the Phrygians were divided by
factions, and in order to restore peace, the deity
commanded that they should elect as king the man
whom they first met on a waggon on the way to the
shrine of Zeus. Then they met Gordius on his waggon
and greeted him as king. Gordius built the city of
Gordium at the confluence of the Scopas and Sangarius,
and dedicated in the temple of Zeus on the citadel of
Gordium the chariot which carried him to the throne.
After Gordius's death the throne descended to his son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
Midas, to whose lips, when a boy, ants had carried
grains of corn. Midas is said to have founded the
city of Gordiutichus in the south of the land, on the
borders of Phrygia, and Ancyra in the north: at
Pessinus on the slope of Mount Agdus he built a
temple to the goddess of Phrygia and established
the sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> He was the richest king who ever
lived. Everything that he touched turned to gold.
Once he bathed in the Pactolus, and ever since the
sands washed down by the river became sands of gold.
When Pan blew his shepherd's pipe, and Apollo
touched his lyre, Midas preferred the music of Pan.
In revenge, Apollo caused asses' ears to grow upon
Midas, and he covered them with a tall cap. But the
barber of Midas knew the secret, and told it into a
pit; and some rushes grew in the pit, and whispered
"Midas has asses' ears."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>The gold of Midas and his power of changing
everything into that metal comes from the Greeks,
whose legends desired to celebrate and explain the
ancient wealth of the kings of Phrygia. From the
same source are the asses' ears and the whispering
rushes. The use of the pan's pipe, though not of the
shepherd's pipe, was learnt by the Greeks through their
colonists in Asia Minor from the Phrygians. The
reed (or flute) was called "eleg" among the Armenians:
its notes first accompanied the Elegies of Callinus of
Ephesus, and Archilochus of Paros, to which it gave
the name. Among the Greeks many judges, and
those by no means of the least reputation, gave
the most decided preference to the music of the
cithara, the lyre of Apollo, over the flute. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
same feeling which prompted this judgment, the
want of taste in finding the tones of the flute more
beautiful than those of the cithara is visited by a
punishment which at the same time is intended to
explain the origin of the tall Phrygian cap. The
reeds belong to a brook in the vicinity of Cel&aelig;n&aelig;
in Phrygia, which the Greeks called "the flute-spring"
(Aulokren&ecirc;) because the reeds growing on the shores
were used as wind-instruments. There is another
story in which the Greeks have expressed the
contrast between the quiet and composed tones of
the cithara, and the wild music of the Phrygian
flutes&mdash;the Phrygian harmonies to which they
ascribed the power of rousing the feelings into a
passionate excitement of pain or delight.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> The music
of the flute was introduced into choric poetry in the
first half of the sixth century by Polymnestus of
Colophon, and Sakadas of Argos. Among the
Phrygians, Marsyas, a faithful and chaste companion
of their national goddess, was the genius of flute-music.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
A brook which flowed into the M&aelig;ander through
the city Apam&aelig;a Cibotus, in the neighbourhood of
Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, was named after Marsyas. The Greeks had
a story that their god Apollo had overcome with his
cithara the flute-player of the Phrygians, and had
flayed him in punishment for his presumption in
entering on the contest. At Cel&aelig;n&aelig; a bottle of
Marsyas was exhibited, on which the story of the
flaying of Marsyas may have been founded.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>After removing the fictions and additions of the
Greeks, the characteristic trait of the Phrygian story
still remains, that their monarchs arose out of the
agricultural class, that grains of corn were carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
into the lips of the son of the first ruler, and that
the king of Phrygia loved the pan's pipe of the
shepherds. Elsewhere also the respect of the
Phrygians for the agricultural life is brought into
prominence. Nicolaus of Damascus tells us of a law
of the Phrygians by which the slaughter of the
ploughing ox, or the theft of agricultural implements,
was punished with death.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> In the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>
the waggon of Gordius was still standing on the citadel
of Gordium. The yoke was bound so fast to the pole
with the bark of dog-wood&mdash;the knot is reported to
been tied by Gordius himself&mdash;that it was said in
Phrygia that the man who should untie this knot
would rule over all Asia. The name Gordius should
apparently be traced back to the Armenian "gords,"
i.e. labour, or "day labour."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> That side by side with
these traits the national tradition ascribed the erection
of the ancient cities and temples, the building of
Gordium, Gordiuteichus, and Ancyra to the earliest
princes, is only natural. The names of the cities
Manegordum (near Ancyra) and Mida&euml;um also point
to these.</p>

<p>The Phrygians obeyed a dynasty which saw its
ancestors in the kings Gordius and Midas, and called
themselves alternately by these names. The first king
of whom we have any more definite information was
Midas, the son of Gordius, who ascended the throne
of Phrygia in the year 738 <small>B.C.</small> according to the date
of Eusebius. His wife was Damodice, the daughter of
Agamemnon, the king of the Greek city of Cyme, who
is said to have been a woman distinguished by beauty
and wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The seat on which he used to dispense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
justice, a work well worth seeing, as Herodotus says,
he consecrated at Delphi. When Phrygia was attacked
by the first great invasion of the Cimmerians,
he took away his own life by drinking bull's
blood (693 <small>B.C.</small>).<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Of a third Midas, who reigned
apparently about a century later, we learn that his
tomb was adorned with the image of a maiden in
brass, and that a Greek poet composed as an inscription
for this monument the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"I am a maiden of brass,<br />
I lie on the tomb of Midas;<br />
While waters flow, and tall trees grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Midas' tearful tomb I lie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I say to every passer by,</span><br />
'Here Midas sleeps in earth below.'"<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a><br />
</p>

<p>With the descendants of this Midas, Gordius and his
son Adrastus, this dynasty came to an end in the
sixth century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Between Prymnessus and Mida&euml;um (Jazili Kaja
and Sidi Ghazi), in the valley of Doganlu, lie the
tombs of these kings, sepulchral chambers, which are
hewn in the perpendicular walls of red sandstone. On
the face of the rock there is no trace of any entrance;
and the corpses must have been lowered down
behind the exterior front. The walls of rock are
changed into sculptures, in imitation of the outlines
and rudiments of a light wooden building. In low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
relief a framework of beams is sketched, and over this
a low-pitched gable rises. Such are the simplest of
these fa&ccedil;ades, which apparently we must also consider
the oldest. Others display a frieze of palm leaves in the
upper field of the framework. Others again put the
figures of animals in the gable, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> two horses, between
which is an obelisk, and exhibit traces of Hellenic
influence, while another presents a perfect imitation of
the Doric arrangement of pillars. Among these sepulchres
may once have been the tomb with the maiden
of brass. The inscriptions found on some, or in the
neighbourhood, are Phrygian, but written in Greek
characters. The most important tomb is that of a
more ancient Midas at K&uuml;mbet. The fa&ccedil;ade of this
monument, which is in framework of the Phrygian
style, covers about sixty square feet of the hundred feet
of the rock. The space in the field of the framework
is entirely filled up with rectangular ornaments and
a kind of scroll, while the tympanum of the gable is
covered with a key pattern.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>Other remarkable remains of buildings are found
in Phrygia. Strabo tells us of a tribe on the borders
of Cilicia who lived in the arches and hollows of the
rocks above the fruitful valley which they cultivated;
till conquered by the Romans the tribe was considered
invincible, and Vitruvius remarks that the Phrygians
excavated the natural hills, cut passages in them, and
extended the spaces into dwellings as far as the nature
of the place allowed.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> On the Rhyndakus, in the district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
of the ancient Prymnessus, at Beibazar, on Lake
Egerdir, to the east near Iconium, numerous habitations
are found excavated in the rocks, so that it really
seems that the Phrygians dwelt in the walls of their
mountains.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Lofty walls of rock, thousands of isolated
cones, and some mighty mountain summits are excavated
into dwellings, into rock cities&mdash;a task which
was rendered easier by the softness of the stone
(peperino and tufa). Steep and at times wonderfully
jagged rocks, overhanging picturesque valleys, are
chiselled out for one or two hundred feet in height in
such a manner that several galleries of habitations lie
one upon the other. These are lighted by openings in
the front, and connected with each other by shafts
and staircases: of seats, hearths, or couches there is no
trace whatever&mdash;only niches and recesses are found.
Yet in some of the rock cities an advance may be
observed. In these the entrances to some extent
exhibit indications of pillars, architraves, portals, and
the like, so that the habitations of this kind seem
to have been built at a later period. The ruins of
the cities of the Phrygians, the remains of Gordium,
Mida&euml;um, Pessinus, Prymnessus, and Ancyra allow
us to see the so-called Cyclopian style.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>Our knowledge of the religious rites of the Phrygians
is extremely scanty. They are said to have
invoked the god Men, or Manes under various titles,<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
and the names of the cities Manegordum and Manesium
seem to go back to this deity. Whether this is
the god whom the Greeks called the Phrygian Zeus
is not clear. The goddess, whom the Greeks called
Rhea or Cybele, Dindymene, Agdistis, after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
mountains sacred to her, is said to have been called
Amma by the Phrygians.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The chief home of her
rites was that sanctuary on Mount Agdus near
Pessinus, which the first Midas is said to have dedicated
to her (<a href="#Page_525">p. 525</a>). Here she was worshipped in
a shapeless stone of no great size, not larger than a
man could lift. At the side of her statue in the
temple lions and panthers are said to have stood.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
Her priests were eunuchs, who waited on the goddess
in gaily coloured vestments. The chief priest
at Pessinus, or Archigallus, is afterwards found
holding a princely position. At the festivals of the
goddess, which were celebrated every year, it was
the custom for young men to make themselves
eunuchs with a sharp shell, crying out at the same
time, "Take this, Agdistis." Then they went round
the country asking alms in the name of the goddess,
and they were known to the Greeks as "Metragyrtes,"
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "beggars of the mother;"<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> for the
goddess, whose priests were eunuchs, and whose
service demanded the sacrifice of sex, was called by
the Greeks the "Great Mother," the "Mountain
Mother," the "Nourishing Earth," the "Giver of
all." She must, therefore, have been regarded as
the maternal power of the earth, the power of nature,
which gives life. It is especially stated that she
gave increase to the flocks,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and since she was named
after different mountains we may assume that high
places and mountains were the chosen seats of her
worship. In Greek and Roman art the Phrygian
goddess is represented as sitting on a chariot drawn
by lions and panthers, with a cymbal in her hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
and wearing on her head the mural crown as the
goddess of the earth which supports cities.</p>

<p>By the side of the Great Mother stands the god
Atys, whom Herodotus calls a son of Manes.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> He
grew up with the shepherds among the goats of the
forest. The goddess loved him, but he fled away
into the mountains, and there, under a fir-tree, into
which his spirit passed, he made himself an eunuch.
In search of him Amma roams over the hills in frantic
grief, and carries into her cave the tree into which
his spirit passed. The emasculation and death of
Atys, as also his resurrection, were celebrated by the
Phrygians.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> At these festivals a fir-tree was felled,
crowned with violets, twined with garlands, and
carried into the sanctuary of the goddess. Afterwards
Atys was sought in the mountains with wild music
and frenzy, as Amma had sought him. The third
day of the festival was "the day of blood," i.e. of the
mutilation and death of Atys, who was bewailed with
despairing grief, amid rending of the hair and beating
of the breast. Then followed a happier scene, the
festival of "the resurrection," and the washing of the
stone of the goddess.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> We learn further that Atys
was also called Papas among the Phrygians. He is
also entitled the goat-herd and neat-herd; the plastic
art of Greece and Rome represents him as a youthful
shepherd with the Pan's-pipe, and by his side is a pine
and a ram. According to later accounts he was the
"shepherd of the bright stars."<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> Hence we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
assume that in Atys the Phrygians personified the
youthful bloom of nature, the bloom of the spring,
and they mourned the disappearance of this, just as,
according to the Greeks, they sang a piercing wail&mdash;the
Lityerses&mdash;at the time of corn-cutting. They
lamented the death of the spring, and the fall of
the fruit; the youthful god had resigned his own
power; the creative vigour continued only to exist in
the tree of Atys, the ever-green fir. In the spring
time it awoke again; this was the day of the resurrection
with its joy and pleasure. This orgiastic
worship, and roaming with wild cries over the heights
and in the ravines of the mountains, sometimes in
wailing and lamentation, sometimes in joy, is peculiar
to the religion of the Phrygians.</p>

<p>The central point of the Phrygian kingdom lay
westwards of the great salt plain in the region between
Gordium and Ancyra, between Mida&euml;um and
Pessinus in the valley of the Sangarius, on whose
banks the Homeric poems place the Phrygians, who
are the possessors of "well-walled cities."<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> If the
majority of the Phrygians remained farmers and
shepherds, they nevertheless arrived at an early date
at a monarchy, and under this they reached a civilisation
by no means contemptible, a national culture,
with an architecture and music of their own. On
the religion of the Phrygians the rites of their Semitic
neighbours on the north and south no doubt exercised
a strong influence. The combination of the creative
power and the power hostile to procreation into one
deity, and the custom of mutilation, are conceptions
and rites unknown to the Aryan nations. But they
are closely connected with the forms and worship of
Astarte-Ashera, just as Atys resembles the Adonis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
of the Syrians. On the other hand, as was remarked
above, the Phrygians adopted the Greek alphabet on
their monuments, and Greek verses were composed
for the tomb of Midas (<a href="#Page_528">p. 528</a>). In return the Greeks
adopted the Phrygian flute, and along with it the
form of the elegy and the Phrygian harmonies. Nor
were these all. The wild roaming, the unchecked
sorrow and joy, the tambourines and drums of the
Phrygian festivals passed without doubt in the first
instance to the Greek colonies in the Propontis, and
more especially to Cyzicus, and from thence to the
mother country at the celebration of certain festivals
of Demeter and Dionysus. "Take," says Euripides in
the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i>, "take the drums, the invention of the
Phrygians and the mother Rhea. Long ago the Corybantes
(the attendants of the Great Mother) devised
the mighty circle of the stretched hide and placed in
Rhea's hand, with the loud, sweet-sounding tone of
Phrygian flutes, the thunder for the festal song."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>Towards the east, the south coast of Asia Minor
was inhabited by the Cilicians and the Solymi. To
the former belonged the slopes of Taurus and the
coast to the right bank of the Kalykadnus. Towards
the west came the Solymi, in a wild and broken
mountain country. They took their name from the
Solyma mountains (<i>sallum</i> = steps), which they inhabited,
and according to Ch&#339;rilus of Samos, they
spoke the language of the Phenicians.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> "The pass," so
Xenophon tells us, "which leads to Cilicia (from the
interior of Asia Minor) is very steep, and only broad
enough for a single waggon. On descending from it
you come into a well-watered plain by the sea, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
is inclosed from one end to the other by lofty and
precipitous mountains. But the plain itself is large and
beautiful, and filled with trees of every kind, and with
vines. It produces much sesame, wheat, millet, and
barley."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> In addition to these advantages the slopes
of Taurus offered splendid pastures for horses, and on
the coast were excellent harbours. The inhabitants
of this favoured land, known in Assyrian inscriptions
as Chillakai, and on the coins of the district from the
Persian times as Chelech,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> belonged, like their neighbours
on the Orontes and on the Upper Euphrates, to
the Semitic stock. This is proved by the names of
their districts and places of their gods, and by the
inscriptions on their coins. The Semitic stamp of
names of places like Amanus (<i>amana</i>, firm), Adana
(<i>eden</i>, delight), Mallus (<i>maa'la</i>, height), Tarsus
(<i>tars</i>, dry) is beyond a doubt.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Herodotus tells us
that the Cilicians wore woollen clothes, and peculiar
helmets of ox-leather, and carried swords and spears
like the Egyptians, and he maintained that they were
descended from Cilix, the son of Agenor, a Phenician.
Their princes were always styled Syennesis.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> This
standing name was, without doubt, the title given by
the princes of Cilicia to themselves: it must have
been <i>schu'a nasi</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "noble prince."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Hellanicus
tells us that of the two kings of the name of Sardanapalus,
who ruled over Assyria, one had built the
two cities of Tarsus and Anchiale in Cilicia in one
day.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> On the other hand Berosus informs us that
Sennacherib (705-681 <small>B.C.</small>) had heard in Assyria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
that an army of Greeks had landed in Cilicia; against
this he marched and defeated it, but with heavy
loss. As a memorial of this victory he caused his
image to be set up there, and afterwards the city
of Tarsus was built in such a way that the Cydnus
flowed through the middle of it. The temple at
Anchiale (west of Tarsus, on the sea) was also
founded by Sennacherib.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> When Alexander of
Macedonia reached Cilicia his attendants found
that the circuit and towers of the walls of Anchiale
proved that the city was planned on a large scale.
Near the walls they saw the statue of an Assyrian
king. His right hand was raised, and the inscription
in Assyrian letters is said to have called him Sardanapalus,
the son of Anakyndaraxes.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>No king of the name of Anakyndaraxes or Sardanapalus
ever ruled over Assyria, unless perhaps by
the latter is meant Assurbanipal (Assurbanhabal), the
son of Esarhaddon. On the other hand, the inscriptions
of Shalmanesar II. of Asshur (859-828 <small>B.C.</small>)
mention the fact that he had overcome "Pikhirim the
chief of the land of Chilakku (Cilicia)," and Sargon, king
of Assyria (722-705 <small>B.C.</small>), tells us that the Cilicians
had not been subject to his father, and that he had
transferred the dominion over Cilicia to Ambris, king
of Tubal. Hence Cilicia must have become subject to
Sargon in the earliest years of his reign. In consequence
of the revolt, which Ambris undertook with
Urza of Ararat, and Mita, the king of Moschi, as
we saw above (<a href="#Page_520">p. 520</a>), Ambris was taken captive
and dethroned in the year 714 <small>B.C.</small> Sennacherib, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
successor of Sargon (705-681 <small>B.C.</small>), informs us that
in the very first years of his reign he had caused
rebellious Cilicians to be removed: the inscriptions of
the later years of his reign remark that the cities of
the Cilicians were destroyed and burnt, and the Cilicians
in the forests were reduced. After this the inscriptions
of Esarhaddon (681-668 <small>B.C.</small>) assure us that
he reduced the Cilicians; and Assurbanipal recounts
that Sandasarmi of Cilicia, who had not submitted to
the kings his fathers, and fulfilled their commands,
sent his daughter with many presents to Nineveh for
the harem of Assurbanipal, and kissed his feet.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>The fall of the Assyrian kingdom restored their
freedom to the Cilicians, and they appear to have
maintained it till the times of Cyrus. After that
time the princes of Cilicia were merely the viceroys
of the kings of Persia. To these sovereigns Cilicia
paid each year 500 Babylonian talents of silver and
360 selected horses. The harbours, which carried on
a lively trade, were able, at the beginning of the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small>, to equip and man a hundred ships of
war (triremes).<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>The coins which have come down to us from the
supremacy of the Persians allow us to form some conclusions
about the religious rites of the Cilician cities.
They represent Baal, the sun-god of the Syrians, on
the throne, with grapes and ears of corn in his right
hand, and sometimes an eagle at his side. Others
exhibit Heracles attacking a lion with his club. The
inscriptions name the god thus represented Bal Tars,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Baal of Tarsus. A coin of Mallus also exhibits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
Heracles strangling the lion, i.e. the beneficent sun-god
who overcomes the terrible sun-god in the sign of
the lion, the consuming glow of the sun. On other
coins we can trace the war-goddess, on others the
birth-goddess of the Syrians, or her cow; some coins
of Celenderis exhibit the goat of this goddess.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>The land of the Cilicians must at one time have
stretched northwards over the Taurus range to the
inner table-land as far as the sources of the Sarus,
to the watershed between the Mediterranean and the
Black Sea, or even further. Sargon could not have
transferred the sovereignty over Cilicia to the king of
Tubal if his territory was not contiguous to Cilicia.
And if we assume that the land of Tubal reached at
that time as far as the Taurus, we are met by the
objection that even Herodotus represents the Halys as
passing through the land of the Cilicians on its way
from Armenia.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> Hence the land afterwards called
Cataonia, between Taurus and Antitaurus and the
northern spur of the latter range, must, even in the
time of Herodotus, have belonged to Cilicia.</p>

<p>On the north-western slope of the Armenian mountains
toward the Black Sea we have already found the
Moschi and Tibarenes, whom the Hebrews counted
among the sons of Japhet. The western neighbours
of the Tibarenes on the coasts of the Black Sea were
the Chalybians. It is the land of the Chalybians of
which the Homeric poems speak, when they mention
the city of Alybe&mdash;"where is the birth of silver."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
But it is not only the obtaining of silver that is
ascribed by the Greeks to the Chalybians; they are
also the discoverers of the working of iron; and steel,
which the Greeks obtained from this coast, was named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
after the Chalybians. &AElig;schylus calls the Chalybians
"barbarous workers in brass, men averse to foreigners."<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
In the scriptures of the Hebrews Tubal-cain,
a name of which the first part seems to denote the
Tibarenes, is the father of the smiths in brass and iron.
Hence it is clear that the mines of ore and iron in the
land of the Tibarenes and Chalybians must have been
opened at a very early period. As a fact the ore lies
at a very slight depth in the mountains. Even now
large masses of copper are discovered along the coast
to the west of Trebizond; beside copper, the mines
of G&uuml;m&uuml;sh Khane, two days' journey in the interior
from Trebizond, even now yield lead containing
silver, which is also found in the mines of Baibut
and Tokat, further to the south.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Hence these districts
could furnish not only iron and steel, but
silver also; elsewhere silver was only to be got in
the mines on Mount Ida till the Phenicians imported
this metal in large quantities from Tartessus.</p>

<p>Westward of the Chalybians on the Thermodon,
the Iris, and the lower course of the Halys, dwelt a
population which, setting aside any later admixture,
were of Semitic origin. Herodotus calls the inhabitants
of the land which reaches from Armenia on the east to
the Halys on the west, from the coast of the Black Sea
southwards as far as Cilicia, Syrians, and remarks that
this was the name of the people in use among the
Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> Pindar speaks of "a spear-armed Syrian

from the Taurus northwards as far as the
Pontus, were named Leuco-Syrians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> white Syrians,
to distinguish them from the true Syrians, and that

them.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> The coins struck at Sinope (Sanab), Side and

people Cappadocians (Katapatuka), and extend the
name to Cilicia also. If the Phrygians when marching
westwards from Armenia not only traversed but
took possession of the land, the Phrygians who remained
in the country must have retired to the west
before the Semitic tribe, which forced its way from
Cilicia and the Upper Euphrates, or have been absorbed
by them.</p>

<p>In the eighth century <small>B.C.</small> the Syrians between
the Lower Halys and Armenia received a peculiar
admixture. "On the shore of the Pontus, where the
Scythians now dwell"&mdash;such is the account of Herodotus&mdash;"it
is said that the territory of the Cimmerians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
lay, and in Scythia the Cimmerian Bosporus and
Cimmerian walls and harbours remain, and a region
which is called Cimmeria. When the Scythians who
once dwelt in the east were driven out by the Massagetes
or the Issedones, they came into the land of the
Cimmerians. The latter took counsel on the river
Tyras, and one part were inclined with the kings to
fight against the Scythians, but the others wished to
abandon the land. Thus a strife arose between the
two parties, and those who wished to retire from the
land defeated the king and all who were of the same
opinion with him, and buried the slain on the Tyras,
where their grave is still to be seen. Then the remainder
fled before the Scythians along the sea to
Asia, and settled on the peninsula, where Sinope, the
city of the Greeks, is now built. But the Scythians
took their land in possession, and, led by their king
Madyas, they pursued the retreating Cimmerians, but
missed them, as they took the upper road, which is
far longer, and keeps the Caucasus on the right."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>We shall return to the Scythians again; for the
present we may leave them out of the question. In
Homer the Cimmerians, "miserable men, who are
veiled in cloud, darkness, and night, and are never
illuminated by the sun," dwell "at the end of earth
and Oceanus, where is the opening of the entrance
into the under-world."<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> As guardians of the under-world
Aristophanes calls them after the dog of Hades,
Cerberians.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> Following the guidance of the Homeric
poems, the Cimmerians were sought in the west,
where the sun sinks, and the entrance to the under-world
was supposed to be; they were placed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
neighbourhood of the Italic Kyme.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> When the
Milesians, about the middle of the eighth century,
discovered the north shore of the Black Sea, they
found in the extreme north, at the end of the earth, a
nation whom the Greeks called Cimmerians. Thus
the entrance into Lake M&aelig;otis obtained among the
Greeks the name of the Bosporus of the Cimmerians,
in contrast to the Bosporus of the Thracians. At a
later time the Cimmerians were identified with the
Germanic Cimbri and the Celtic Kymri.</p>

<p>Hence the decision would seem to be correct that
the Cimmerians ought to be struck out of history as
a mythical nation and a mythical name, which was
perhaps intended to correspond to the misty, wintry
nature of some remote lands, did not the poet Callinus
of Ephesus, whose date falls about the year 700 <small>B.C.</small>,
speak of "the approaching army of the Cimmerians,
who achieved mighty deeds:" did not Herodotus
himself tell us that the expelled Cimmerians "settled
on the peninsula at the place where the Greek city
of Sinope now stands"; and also narrate that the
Cimmerians, while king Ardys ruled over the Lydians
(654-617 <small>B.C.</small>), invaded Lydia, and captured Sardis,
the metropolis, except the citadel; and that Alyattes
king of Lydia (612-563 <small>B.C.</small>) first expelled the
Cimmerians entirely out of Asia Minor:<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> did not
Aristotle tell us that the Cimmerians had been settled
for a hundred years in Antandros, on the Trojan coast,
and Scymnus of Chius, that the Milesian Abron,
who founded Sinope, was said to have been slain by
the Cimmerians, that Coes and Cretines founded the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
city anew, "after the Cimmerians, when their array
traversed Asia"?<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>The Cimmerians then were not a legendary fiction:
the Cimmerian Bosporus really owed its name to a
people who called themselves, or were known to the
Greeks, by this name, as also the hamlet of Cimmerikum
on the Crimea, and Cimmerium on the peninsula
of Kertch. Strabo, the best authority on the Eastern
districts of Asia Minor, of which he was a native,
says: "The wanderings of the Scythian Madys (it is
the Madyas of Herodotus) and of Kobos the Trerian
are unknown to most people. The Cimmerians, who
are called Treres,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> or a tribe of them, dwelt on the
gloomy Bosporus. They came from a far distant
region, and are said to have been driven out by
the Scythians. They have often attacked the right
side, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the eastern side of the Pontus, and fought
against the Cappadocians, Paphlagonians, and Phrygians;<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
they crossed the Halys, and forced their way
as far as the Ionian cities.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Their first invasion is
placed by the chronologers in the time of Midas, who
put an end to his life by drinking bull's blood, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
as we saw above (<a href="#Page_528">p. 528</a>) in the period from 738 to
693 <small>B.C.</small>, or according to others, in the time of Homer,
or shortly before him.<a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> But Lygdamis, with a horde of
his own, forced his way to Lydia and Ionia, and conquered
Sardis, though he remained in Cilicia.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> Callisthenes
says that Sardis was first taken by the Cimmerians,
then by the Treres, and finally by Cyrus. The
first capture is also proved by Callinus. At length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
the Treres, under Kobos, are said to have been
driven out by the Scythians under Madys."<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>From this account it is clear that the Cimmerians,
or a part of them, were called Treres, a name also given
to a Thracian tribe between the Skomius and Hebrus,
on the Bistonian Lake;<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> that they made at least two
invasions into the west of Asia Minor; that the second
of these, which in Strabo is undertaken under the
command of Lygdamis, is the same as the invasion of
the Cimmerians which Herodotus places in the time
of king Ardys of Lydia. In both writers this invasion
extends to Sardis and to some of the Greek cities
on the coast, and Plutarch expressly establishes the
identity of the invasion of the Treres under Lygdamis
with that of the Cimmerians in Herodotus, on ancient
authorities.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Justin calls the Cimmerians a part of
the Scythians, who, owing to their internal contentions,
migrated under the leadership of Ilinus and Scolopitus,
and established themselves on the coast of
Cappadocia.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>The incursion of the Scythians into Media, with
which Herodotus has combined the migration of the
Cimmerians, took place, as we shall show from
Herodotus' own statement, about the year 630 <small>B.C.</small>
But if Alyattes of Lydia was the first to expel the
Cimmerians from the west of Asia Minor after they
had been settled for a century in Antandros, these Cimmerians
must have been in Asia at least as early as
663 <small>B.C.</small>, since Alyattes reigned till 563 <small>B.C.</small> Further,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
if Herodotus only mentions the destruction of Sardis,
which took place about 630 <small>B.C.</small>, and is wholly silent
on the first destruction by the Cimmerians, this first
capture must have taken place before the time from
which he commences his accurate account of Lydian
history, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> before the accession of Gyges in the year
689 <small>B.C.</small>, or, according to the data of Herodotus, even
before 719 <small>B.C.</small> This capture of Sardis is the only
one which could have been known to Callinus.
Further, the Cimmerians are said to have invaded
Phrygia at the time of that Midas who put himself
to death in the year 693 <small>B.C.</small> Hence they must have
been in Asia Minor before this year, and if they
overpowered Phrygia, they could easily at the same
time have forced their way as far as the western
coast. Moreover, Strabo remarks that the Milesians
built Sinope, when they had become acquainted with
the favourable position of the place and the weakness
of the people, but the people were not weak after
the Cimmerians had occupied the mouth of the
Halys. The first foundation of Sinope under Abron
must therefore be placed before the arrival of the
Cimmerians in Asia Minor. The ancient Sinope
founded the city of Trapezus in the year 756 <small>B.C.</small>,<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> and
therefore that city must have been founded at least ten
years earlier, and its destruction by the Cimmerians
must be placed after the year 756 <small>B.C.</small> Hence the
Cimmerians might have reached the mouth of the
Halys about 750 <small>B.C.</small>, though they cannot have come
along the coast from Colchis, but over the sea. With
this agrees the statement that the Cimmerians forced
their way into Asia Minor in the year 782.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

<p>From this investigation it follows that the Cimmerians
once possessed the north shore of the Black Sea
on the straits from Kaffa, westward perhaps as far as
the mouth of the Danube. Since the Treres, a Thracian
nation, are always mentioned in connexion with the
Cimmerians, and it is ascertained that Thracian tribes
possessed the western coast of Pontus from the Thracian
Bosporus northwards as far as the mouth of the Danube,
and as the Agathyrsi in Transylvania are also called
Thracians, there can hardly be any doubt remaining
that the Cimmerians were of Thracian origin, or at
least nearly related to the Thracians. According to
the account of Herodotus the Cimmerians held a
consultation on the Tyras (Dniester), their kings were
said to have been killed there, and in confirmation
of the story he appeals to the tumuli which were still
to be seen on the Dniester. The only certain conclusion
to be drawn from this statement is that
mounds on the Dniester were shown to Herodotus
as coming down from an older population of those
districts. The Cimmerians, who arrived in Asia
Minor (the Tauri, on the peninsula which was named
after them, appear to be a remnant of this nation,
who maintained their old settlements, and the modern
name Crimea goes back to the Cimmerians), must
have been a numerous and martial people, if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
were able not only to establish themselves firmly in
the East on the Halys, but also to force their way to
the western coast, there to settle down in several
places and maintain themselves in these, and to
capture twice the fortified metropolis of the Lydians,
the most warlike nation in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>According to the genealogy in Genesis, Gomer is
the eldest son of Japhet. This name is without doubt
the Semitic term for the population on the north
shore of the Pontus, who were known to the Greeks
as Cimmerians. In the sixth century <small>B.C.</small> the prophet
Ezekiel mentions Gomer beside Togarmah.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Esarhaddon,
king of Assyria (681-668 <small>B.C.</small>), tells us
that Tiuspa from the distant land of the Cimmerians
(Gimirai) submitted to him with his army.
Assurbanipal (668-626 <small>B.C.</small>) relates: "The Cimmerians
were not afraid of my fathers or of me, and
would not take the yoke of my sovereignty. Gugu
(Gyges), king of Ludi (Lydia), a land beyond the sea,
a distant region, of which my fathers had not heard
the name, sent a messenger into my presence, in order
to implore my friendship and kiss my feet. From
the day on which he accepted my yoke, he took
Cimmerians, desolators of his land, alive in the battle
with his own hand. From the number of the
captured leaders he bound two with strong fetters
of iron, and sent them with numerous presents to
Nineveh, the city of my dominion. He constantly
sent messengers to ask for my friendship. He
omitted to do so when he disregarded the will of
Asshur, the god, my creator, trusted to his own
power, and hardened his heart. He sent his forces to
aid Pisamilki (Psammetichus), king of Egypt, who had
thrown off the yoke of my sovereignty. I heard this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
and prayed to Asshur and Istar thus: May his body
be cast out to his enemies, and his servants be carried
away captive. Asshur answered me: His body shall
be cast out to his enemies, and his servants carried
away captive. The Cimmerians, whom he had brought
under his feet by the renown of my name, conquered
and laid waste his whole land. His son (Ardys) sat
upon his throne. He sent to me and received the
yoke of my supremacy, saying thus: I am thy subject
and servant, and my people will do all thy will."<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>Thus the account of the Greeks is completely
established. To be subjugated by Esarhaddon the
Cimmerians must have been in Asia Minor in the
first decades of the seventh century <small>B.C.</small>, they must
also have got the upper hand here to such a degree that
Gyges, king of Lydia, found it impossible to defend
himself against them without the help of the Assyrians.
The first capture of Sardis must have taken place
before the accession of Gyges, on that campaign which
the Cimmerians made in the year 693 <small>B.C.</small> to Phrygia.
On the other hand it may be that the Cimmerians had
got possession of the city of Antandrus in the reign
of Gyges. When Gyges had repulsed the Cimmerians
he thought that he had no longer any need of
Assyria. For this, according to Assurbanipal, he
was punished by a second invasion of the Cimmerians,
who desolated his land; he lost his life in the
battle, of which the Greeks know nothing, and his
son and successor Ardys was again forced to submit
to Assyria. That Ardys had to fight severe
battles with the Cimmerians is proved by the second
capture of Sardis, which took place in his reign
about the year 630 <small>B.C.</small> While the Cimmerians
were thus engaged in the West, the city of Miletus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
or some exiled Milesians, seized the opportunity to
re-found Sinope. Alyattes succeeded in forcing back
the Cimmerians and attacking them with such vigour
that they were no longer able to undertake any
invasions to the West. Even Sinope had no more
to fear from them, although their settlements lay in
the neighbourhood of this city. At a subsequent
period in the third century <small>B.C.</small> the invading Celts
threw the whole of Asia Minor into a panic, and
plundered it, until they were confined to Galatia;
and the invasion of the Cimmerians appears to have
taken a similar course. The Celts, however, maintained
themselves within a limited district; the
Cimmerians disappeared so entirely among the Cappadocians,
that Syncellus calls Gomer the progenitor
of the Cappadocians, and the Armenians denote the
Cappadocians by the name Gamir.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>In Cappadocia also, rock tombs, sculptures, and
fragments of buildings have been discovered, the
authors of which and the date of their erection we
cannot ascertain even approximately. Near Amasia,
on the middle course of the Iris, we find graves hewn
in the rocks, of which those lying nearest the city
may have belonged to the first kings of Pontus.
Near Aladja also the fa&ccedil;ade of a large rock-tomb may
be seen. Near Uej&uuml;k, on an elevated terrace, are the
ruins of a palace, the lower part of which is formed by
great blocks worked and joined in the Cyclopian
style, and the blocks are in part covered with
sculptures. In the middle of the south front is a
spacious doorway guarded by two pairs of lions; one
pair is detached, the other is worked out of the stone
posts of the doorway, like the protecting figures in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
the palaces of Nineveh.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Near Boghaskoi, which is
perhaps the site of the ancient city of Pteria, at the
foot of a lofty limestone plateau, overhung by cones
of rock, in the fork of a mountain stream which flows
northward to the Halys, are the remains of a building
about 200 feet in length and 140 feet in breadth. A
broad staircase leads from the river to a terrace, on
which rises the palace surrounded by a wall. As at
Uej&uuml;k, the lower part of the structure consists of
Cyclopian blocks of fifteen to twenty feet in length,
and some six feet in depth. About thirty chambers,
greater or smaller, surround the court of this structure.
The ground plan is like that of the palaces of Nineveh;
in the sculptures a resemblance has been traced to the
reliefs of the buildings of the Ach&aelig;menids. Pteria
was afterwards the abode of a Persian commander. On
the rocky plateau over the palace we see the remains
of two citadels, surrounded by lines of fortification, of
which the Cyclopian foundations may still be traced.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>
Two miles and a half to the north-west of the ruins
of the citadels, in the rocks surrounding the plateau,
remarkable sculptures have been discovered. In a
deep recess of the rocks the rough walls, which
have been but slightly hewn and smoothed, are
covered with reliefs. There are two rows of figures
which meet each other. They advance from the
outer curve of the niche along the side-walls, on the
right and left, towards the back wall. While the
figures in these rows are only from two to three feet
high, the shapes on the back wall, which form the
centre of the picture, are of the size of life, and indeed
the main figure is even larger. All the figures are in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
profile. The main figure, which moves from left to
right, as does the long row of figures following it on
the left side of the niche, is a bearded warrior, who
steps over, or even upon, two bending figures with
high and pointed caps, falling over in front, and in
garments which fall in folds from the girdle. In his
right hand he carries a sceptre, the left hand, which is
not very distinct, holds a flower out of which peers a
circle, or an oval ring. His doublet hardly reaches to
the knee; the head is covered with a tall conical cap,
and on the feet are pointed shoes. He is followed by
two male figures suitably clothed, who stand on mountain
summits; then between two winged genii are two
figures with round caps, who carry bowls, and behind
them a form in a long garment, with a bent staff in
his hand, and a winged circle on his head. Then
follow warriors armed with sabres, or clubs, in the
same short doublet and the same pointed shoes as the
three leaders, and between them are two demons, the
only figures presenting a full face, with round, broad
faces, who carry two segments of a circle, one upon
the other. They were followed by warriors and two
priests with pointed caps falling over in front. The
end of the row on the left entrance is formed by a
series of twelve warriors, who march on without
armour, close together, and with even step. On the
right side of the niche is another row, coming to
meet the row described. Opposite the leader of the
warriors, in the middle of the north wall, is a large
female figure, who advances from the right to the
left on a lion or leopard, whose feet rest on four
mountain summits. She wears a long robe falling in
folds to her ankles; her hair streams down, and upon
it is a cylindrical head-dress; the right hand carries
a staff, while the left, which holds something similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
to the ring already mentioned, is held out towards
the outstretched left hand of the leader of the
warriors. Behind her, on a smaller scale, but also
riding on a lion with the feet resting on mountain
summits, is a youthful warrior, without a beard, in
the clothing of the main figure; the head is covered
with a lofty pointed cap, the shoes are also pointed;
in the girdle is the two-edged bill, in the left hand
a long battle-axe, and in the right a staff. He is
followed by two female figures above a double eagle,
in the dress of the main female figure; behind them
come thirteen more female figures of a similar kind,
with staves or harps in their hands. The whole picture
contains more than sixty figures. In a niche receding
to the back we find, beside a demon of remarkable
shape, a young beardless man with an exceedingly tall
conical cap; in his outstretched right hand he appears
to carry the picture of a temple; and with his left
he embraces the neck of a very youthful female form,
whose head-dress and robe fall down in numerous
folds. Beside them march twelve warriors with lower
caps than those in the main recess, and scythe swords
in their right hands; the left arm is raised as high as
the shoulder, since they are treading on the left heel,
and the top of the right foot.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p>If this great rock picture is not intended to
represent some act of religious worship, it might
depict the conclusion of a treaty between two nations.
In this case it might belong to the period in which
Media, under Cyaxares, extended her borders to the
Halys, and came into fierce conflict with the Lydians.
This war was brought to an end by a treaty of peace,
accompanied by the betrothal of the daughter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
Alyattes of Lydia to the son of Cyaxares. The
picture might be explained in reference to this treaty
and betrothal, did not the style and manner appear
closely allied to the figure near Smyrna (<a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>),
and a relief not far from Ancyra.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<p>As to the religious rites of the Cappadocians, we
know that they worshipped the god Men, who is
called a moon-god, and a female deity, Mene, or Ma.
On the Lycus, an affluent of the Iris, at Cabeira,
stood the sanctuary of Men in the middle of large
precincts; the sanctuary of Mene was at Comana, on
the Iris, and was the oldest, richest, and most important
sanctuary in the land. Ma, or Mene, was a war-goddess
whom Greeks and Romans called Enyo and
Bellona; to Strabo she is known as Artemis, and this
name is evidence of her relation to the moon, no less
than of her position as a war-goddess. That relation is
confirmed by further evidence. Comana, says Strabo,
is thickly populated; but the inhabitants are effeminate;
the greater part are fanatics or religious maniacs,
and there is also a number of women who serve the
goddess with their bodies, of whom the greater part
are dedicated to the temple. Here, twice in the year,
the "Exodus of the Goddess" was celebrated. To
this festival pilgrims, male and female, came from
every side, and in frenzy and ecstasy performed
certain sacred customs, which consisted partly in
wounding themselves with swords, and partly in
sensual excesses. In the south of Cappadocia, on the
upper Sarus, there was a second city of Comana,
which also possessed a sanctuary of Ma. Here, as at
Comana on the Iris, six thousand servants are said to
have attended upon Ma.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> We know the tendencies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
of the Syrian worship, to bring man, by means of
certain services, nearer to the deity to whom the
services are performed, and make him resemble the
peculiar nature of the deity whom he worships. The
maidens who served the maiden goddess in her
temples on the Pontus carried weapons like the
goddess, and honoured her by dancing in armour.</p>

<p>Out of these armed maidens in the temples of Ma
there grew up among the Greeks a peculiar and
widely-developed legend&mdash;the legend of the warlike
tribe of the Amazons. When the Greek colonists
landed on the western coast of Asia Minor, they
found, in the land of the Lydians, where they built
Smyrna, Cyme, and Ephesus, seats of the worship of
a goddess whom they compared to their Artemis, and
whose attendants were eunuchs and armed maidens
(<a href="#Page_556">p. 556</a>). They next perceived that similar seats of
worship were to be found in the East also, on the
coasts of the Pontus. Thus the Homeric poems
already placed the "Amazons equal to men" on the
east of the Phrygians, and represented king Priam as
meeting them with his men on the banks of the
Sangarius.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> As natives of Asia Minor the Amazons
must have fought with the Trojans against the Greeks.
Arctinus represented the Amazons as coming to Troy
after the death of Hector, and distressing the Greeks
till Achilles slew their queen, the beautiful "Penthesilea,
the daughter of the dread, manslaying
Ares." The cyclic poets knew the abode of the
Amazons more accurately than Homer; they place
them at Themiscyra, on the Thermodon;<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> and at this
place Pindar represents them as drawing up their
army. &AElig;schylus also places the Amazons on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
Thermodon;<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> according to Pherecydes the war-god
begot the Amazons with Harmonia on the Thermodon.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>
We have seen that the Greeks gave the
name Harmonia to Astarte, the moon-goddess of the
Phenicians. When the Greeks at the time of Arctinus
had founded Sinope and Trapezus in those
regions, they believed that they were in the land of
the Amazons; and Sinope was thought to have been
previously inhabited by the Amazons.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> The places at
which the Greeks here founded a new home were
thought to have been named and sanctified long
before their arrival, not only by the voyage of the
Argonauts, for Heracles, Theseus, and Peirithous were
said to have set foot there, in order to perform their
mighty deeds against the Amazons. At the command
of Eurystheus Heracles had been compelled to bring
the girdle from Hippolyte, the queen of the Amazons,
for Admete. Theseus and Peirithous had carried off
Antiope. Among the Phenicians, as we have seen,
Baal-Melkarth looses the girdle of the moon-goddess;
the Greeks transferred the legend of Melicertes to
their Heracles. Even as early as the thirteenth or
twelfth century <small>B.C.</small> the ships of the Phenicians had
probably brought the worship of the warlike moon-goddess
to the coast of Attica. At any rate, at a
later time, tombs of the Amazons, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> abandoned
seats of the worship of the Artemis of Syria and
Asia Minor, were shown there. After the Attic
territory was united under the rule of a military
monarchy, of which, among the Ionians, Theseus was
the embodiment, the Phenicians were driven back
from the coasts of the Greeks: Theseus was said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
have conquered the Minotaur and the Amazons. In
order to establish the existence of Amazons in Attica,
Theseus was said to have carried off Antiope. To
avenge this wrong, the Amazons marched from their
distant home on the Thermodon to Attica; and the
Athenians considered it one of their greatest services
towards their common fatherland that they had conquered
the Amazons, "an enemy who threatened all
Hellas."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>Out of these elements the Greeks framed a circumstantial
history of the Amazons. Even among the
historians, their home is the land of the Thermodon.
Here the Amazons dwelt, according to Herodotus,
Diodorus, and Strabo, and here, as Diodorus tells us,
they offered splendid sacrifices to Ares and Artemis
Tauropolus. Their first queen is said to have been
the daughter of Ares, and she built the great city of
Themiscyra; the second queen extended the dominion
of the Amazons as far as Syria; and finally queen
Myrina reduced the whole of Syria, and received the
voluntary submission of the Cilicians.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> It is obvious
that the Amazons founded all the cities where the
worship of the maiden war-goddess flourished or had
ever existed. Roused by the crime of Theseus, they
marched to the west, founded the sanctuary of
Ephesus, where "they set up the image of the goddess
under the trunk of an elm, and, armed with shields,
danced the war-dance, so that their quivers sounded."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
Then they marched to the north, and founded Smyrna,
Myrina, and Cyme.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Analogous rites proved that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
were also in Lesbos and Samothrace. Through Thrace
and Thessaly, and finally across Eub&#339;a, they are said
to have marched to Attica; tombs of the Amazons
were shown at Scotussa and Cynoscephal&aelig;, in Thessaly,
and at Chalcis, in Eub&#339;a.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> After returning home, the
Amazons next marched to the aid of the Trojans, and
were conquered by Achilles. When the Greeks had
founded Cyrene on the coast of Attica, and found,
among the Libyan tribes of the surrounding district,
the worship of a female war-goddess&mdash;when they
found the Libyan women wearing corslets of goatskins,
they came to the conclusion that the Amazons
once dwelt on the Tritonian lake in Libya.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>A nation of heroines was certainly never found by
the Greeks on the Thermodon. On the other hand,
they received accounts of the warlike queens of the
Saces and Massaget&aelig;, of Zarin&aelig;a, Sparethra, and
Tomyris, who fought against the Medes and Persians;
and on the coasts of the Black Sea, in the colonies of
the Milesians, they heard of the riding, the archery,
and hunting of the women of the Sauromat&aelig;. Hence
the Greeks resolved to make the Amazons the ancestors
of the Sarmatians. They were represented as
taking ship from the Thermodon across the Black Sea
to the coast of the M&aelig;otis, because here, in the
Crimea, on the "promontory of the maiden," a cruel
maiden goddess, who was also called Artemis Tauropolus
by the Greeks, was worshipped. Herodotus,
and after him Ephorus, tells us that the Amazons fled
over the Pontus from the Thermodon, and landed on
the shore of the M&aelig;otis. Here they took the young
men among the Scythians, who, according to Herodotus,
were settled between the mouths of the Danube<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
and the Don, as their husbands, and with them
marched eastwards over the Tanais (Don), beyond
which river and north of the Caucasus lay, according
to Herodotus, the dwellings of the Sauromat&aelig;, whom
later writers call the Sarmatians. Hence the Sarmatian
women still preserved the customs of the
Amazons; they carried bows and javelins, and wore
the same clothing as the men, sat on horseback, and
rode with or without their husbands to the chase or
to battle, and no maiden married till she had slain an
enemy; "so that some never married at all, because
they were unable to satisfy this rule." The language
of the Sauromat&aelig; was the same as the language
of the Scythians, but they spoke it badly, because
the Amazons had never perfectly learned it. These
statements, and especially the assertion that the
Sarmatian women fought as long as they were
maidens, were repeated by Greek writers&mdash;in other
respects very trustworthy&mdash;in the fifth and fourth
century <small>B.C.</small> Others also maintained that the women
were rulers among the Sarmatians.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Poetry and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
plastic art had stamped the legend of the Amazons
so firmly on the Greeks that they could not break
loose from it. Several of the historians of Alexander
of Macedon tell us that the queen Thalestris, with
300 Amazons, sought out Alexander from a great
distance, and made a proposal of marriage to him,
on his return from Hyrcania,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> a story which has
perhaps arisen out of the fact that the satrap Atropates
of Media sent 100 mounted women to Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>
When at a later time Pompey fought in the
Caucasus, and women were found among the wounded,
it was thought that the real Amazons were at last
found;<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and the story was now told that the Amazons
dwelt northward of the Gelen (in Ghilan), on the
southern foot of the Caucasus. In order to solve the
difficulty of their propagation of the race, the story
was invented that for two months in the spring
they met the Gargareans&mdash;a neighbouring tribe&mdash;on
the mountains by night, and associated with them,
as accident might determine. The boys were then
sent to the Gargareans, who brought them up in
common; the daughters were retained by the
Amazons.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> In order to explain the name Amazon,
which in Greek can mean "without a breast," the
story was invented that they burnt off the right breast
of the maidens, so that they might use the right arm
better, and draw the bow&mdash;a story which Hippocrates
had already told about the daughters of the Sarmatians.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>
On the monuments of plastic art the Amazons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
have both breasts; the older period represents them
with a broad girdle, an ample robe, and a Phrygian
cap, a crescent shield (the symbol of the moon-goddess),
a bow, and a battle-axe. In later sculptures
the Amazons, when they had been connected with
the Scythians and the Sarmatians, were generally
represented on horseback, in a Doric tunic, with naked
arms and thighs, a helmet on the head, and a spear
in the hand.</p>

<p>On the western slopes of the table-land of Asia
Minor, in the river valleys of the Hermus and
M&aelig;ander, the Lydians were settled. Their land
reached from the sources of the Hermus in Mount
Dindymon to the &AElig;gean sea, from Messogis and
Cadmus in the south to the Temnus range in the
north. The valley of the Hermus was exuberantly
fertile, and still more luxuriant was the vegetation
in the district round the Gyg&aelig;an lake. The mountain
pastures supported herds of powerful horses and
numerous flocks of sheep. The Pactolus brought
sands of gold down from Tmolus; in the rocks of
this range and its western continuation, Sipylus,
rich veins of gold are said to have been found.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>But little has been preserved of the legendary
accounts of the Lydians about their rulers in the
earliest times. About the middle of the fifth century
<small>B.C.</small> the Lydian Xanthus, the son of Candaules, wrote
the history of his people in four books, in the Greek
language. Of this some fragments have come down
to us, which can here and there be supplemented by the
statements of Herodotus. From both we learn that
the Lydians traced back the origin of their royal
house to the gods.  Atys, the son of the god Manes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
was the first sovereign of the Lydians; after him came
his son Lydus, who gave the name to the people.
From the brother of Lydus, whom Xanthus calls
Torrhebus, and Herodotus Tyrsenus, the tribe of the
Torrhebians or Tyrsenians was derived. The territory
of the Torrhebi lay on the upper Cayster. From
Asius, the son of Cotys, the son of Atys, sprang
the tribe of the Asion&aelig;ans, who inhabited the Asian
meadow.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> From Atys, their progenitor, the first
king, his successors, the first house of Lydian kings,
were called Atyads. Among the successors of Lydus
the most pious and just was Alkimus. During his
reign there was peace and quiet in Lydia; every man
lived securely and without fear, and all things prospered.
After him reigned king Akiamus, who sent
Ascalus with an army to Syria. There Ascalus
founded the city of Ascalon. After this, as Herodotus
narrates, a lion was born to king Meles from his
concubine, and this lion, in obedience to an oracle,
he caused to be carried round the walls of Sardis,
his metropolis, in order that they might be impregnable.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
According to Xanthus, Meles, who was a
tyrannous and cruel king, was overthrown by Moxus,
a very just and brave man, after he had vowed to
the gods that, in gratitude for their deliverance, the
Lydians should henceforth offer to them a tenth of
all their animals. Then Moxus marched to Syria, and
there took Atargatis captive, with her son Ichthys
(fish). As a punishment for her rebellion she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
thrown into the lake of Ascalon, and eaten by the
fish. Then king Cambletes reigned, who sacrificed
his wife, and ate her, and then slew himself with his
sword before all the people. After him Jardanus,
who had been an enemy of Cambletes, ruled over
Lydia.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Jardanus was followed by his daughter
Omphale.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> To avenge the insult which had been
paid to her before she ascended the throne of Lydia,
she compelled the maidens of the land to give themselves
up to the slaves at an appointed place, and
slew the strangers whom she entertained, when she
had lain with them.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> After Omphale, Tylon reigned,
who died from the bite of a snake, but was again
restored to life by a marvellous herb.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> But with the
slave-girl of Jardanus, according to Herodotus, or,
according to others, with Omphale, Heracles begot
Alc&aelig;us; the son of Alc&aelig;us was Belus; the son of
Belus was Ninus, and the son of Ninus was Agron.
With the accession of Agron the dominion of the
Atyads came to an end, and that of the Heracleids
commenced, who then continued to rule over Lydia
for 505 years.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>Manes and Atys are already known to us as deities
of the Phrygians; they must therefore have been
worshipped by the Lydians also. Lydus, the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
king of the land, is taken from the name of the
nation. The prosperous, peaceful reign of the good
king Alkimus is no doubt founded on some conception
of an early happy age. The story of the lion of Meles
obviously goes back to the relations in which the lion
was placed, in the religious rites of the Syrians, to the
sun-god, who was also worshipped with zeal by the
Lydians. We learn from a Lydian that the name
Sardis was given to the city in honour of the sun-god.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
The coins of Sardis which have been preserved
regularly present the image of a lion and a bull.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> The
vow of Moxus is intended to explain the blood-tithe,
which we have already found in use among the tribes of
Syria. Still more definite are the references to Syrian
rites in the supposed marches of Moxus and Ascalus
to Syria, and the prominent position of Atargatis<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> and
the temple of Ascalon, and the children of Atargatis,
the fish. We know Atargatis, the Astarte of the
Assyrians, as transformed into Hera, and the temple
at Ascalon, the city of the Philistines, as the oldest
and most famous sanctuary of the Syrian goddess
of fertility. The name of the king Jardanus does
not differ from "jarden" (river), and if Omphale
is said to have forced the maidens of the land to
prostitute themselves at a fixed place, we have
already found this prostitution in the worship of
the Syrian goddess of birth and the Babylonian
Mylitta. The new dynasty which ascends the throne
of Lydia after the Atyads with Agron is again
derived from a god, according to the accounts of
the Greeks, from Heracles and Omphale. The Greeks
narrated that Omphale carried the lion's skin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
club of Heracles, and that she clothed the hero in
a transparent female robe of scarlet, and caused him
to card wool and spin as her slave.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Lydian coins
exhibit a female form with the lion's skin and the
bow.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> It was shown above that the Greeks connected
Melkarth (Melicertes) with their Heracles, and that
according to the mythus of the Syrians, the sun-god
finds and overpowers the moon-goddess; that after
the holy marriage, the god on his part succumbs to
the goddess, and changes his nature with her; he
assumes the female nature, she the male; she carries
the weapons, while he performs woman's work. We saw
that the Syrians symbolised the pre-eminent nature,
the unity of the deity, in this amalgamation of the
sexes&mdash;this female manhood and male womanhood.
Johannes Lydus tells us that the Lydians worshipped
the sun-god under the name Sandon, and adds, that
because Sandon had lived as a woman, the men at the
mysteries of the god clothed themselves in women's
clothes, and put on transparent crimson garments,
coloured with vermilion.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Thus the Greeks put their
hero in the place of the Lydian sun-god, who overwhelms
the lion, and changes his nature with the
goddess; and if they farther tell us that Omphale gave
her love to strangers, but also slew all who lay with
her, this also is a trait which had already met us in
the Syrian Astarte, in the nature of Ashera-Astarte,
which at one time grants the enjoyment of love, and
at another brings destruction.</p>

<p>The result of these considerations proves that the
traits of the Lydian legends, which have been pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>served,
present us with very little beyond mere
mythical elements. The connection of the Lydian
worship with the worship of the Syrians comes
plainly to the surface, and this connection is confirmed
by all that we know from other sources of the
rites of the Lydians. The name of their sun-god
Sandon<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> recurs on Assyrian monuments, where it
appears as Sandan.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> In the Semitic languages the
word means "helper," and is used as an attribute of
the god Adar, with whom we are already acquainted
as the god of the planet Saturn.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> It is obvious that
the title "helper" could be given not to Adar only,
but to any other god, from whom special favour and
assistance might be expected. The Lydians gave the
title to the good sun-god, who vanquishes the glowing
heat&mdash;the terrible sun-god&mdash;who looses the girdle of
the moon-goddess, and changes his nature with her.
When the Greek colonists landed on the coast of
Lydia, they at first recognised their own Apollo, i.e.
their god of light, in the Lydian god. They allowed
the sanctuary of the Lydian god at Miletus to remain in
the hands of a family of native priests, the Branchid&aelig;.
As god of the country and protector of the coast, the
Homeric poems give to Apollo the foremost place
among the deities who defend Troy. The Lydians
also on their side recognised the connection between
their sun-god and the Apollo of the Greeks; Gyges
and Cr&#339;sus send rich presents to Delphi. But when
the Greeks of the coast became more accurately
acquainted with the nature and the myths of the
Lydian sun-god, that side which chiefly corresponded
to their Heracles, and the image of Heracles developed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
under the influence of the Phenician Melkarth, came
into prominence. The nature of the female goddess
also, whom the Lydians chiefly worshipped, is
beyond doubt. Herodotus tells us that all the
daughters of the Lydians sold themselves, and in
this way collected their dowries; others narrate
that they received slaves or foreigners in the groves
and porticoes of the temples.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> As we have seen,
tradition connects this prostitution with the rule of
Omphale, and Johannes Lydus assures us that the
goddess Blatta worshipped in Lydia was the same as
the Mylitta of the Babylonians. Hence the worship
of Bilit, the Ashera of the Syrians, prevailed also
among the Lydians, a fact which the campaigns
(already mentioned) of Ascalus and Moxus to the
shrine of Derceto at Ascalon also prove. That this
goddess of the Lydians was not without her destructive
side&mdash;the power and nature of Astarte&mdash;we could
already infer from the bloody acts of Omphale (<a href="#Page_562">p. 562</a>).
At the mouths of the Cayster and the Hermus the
Greeks found the shrines of a goddess, whose priests
were eunuchs, and who was at the same time honoured
with dances in armour by maidens, as the moon and
war-goddess of the Cappadocians.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> This goddess of
the coasts of Lydia was called by the Greeks Artemis,
and this name distinguishes her as at once a maiden
goddess and the goddess of the moon and of war.
And if at the same time the image of Artemis of
Ephesus was represented with large breasts, the
obvious conclusion is that in the goddess of Lydia,
as in the goddesses of Babylonia and Syria, the
two opposites, of continence and sensual enjoyment,
of fertility and of destruction, were united.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span></p>

<p>The forms of religious worship also would appear to
have been in all essentials the same among the Lydians
and the Syrians. Mutilation (which we know was
practised very widely among the Lydians),<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> and the
prostitution of girls, were common to both countries.
We found above that the Arabs and Syrians believed
their gods to be present in stones, and prayed to them
in that shape. Not far from Magnesia on Sipylus,
a stone, some twenty feet in height, juts out of a wall
of marble, and this in ancient times must have been
regarded with veneration as the idol of a native
goddess. Even in the Homeric poems we find mention
of this stone, and the legend connected with it
by the Greek colonists. "I have seen the stone of
Niobe on Sipylus," said Pausanias. "At a near view
it is a fragment of stone, which does not look like a
woman or a person weeping; but from a distance you
might believe that you saw a weeping and mourning
woman."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

<p>The essential result of the examination of Lydian
legend and Lydian worship is the obvious and very
close relationship between the Lydian and Syrian
deities and rites. Moreover, the mountain range
which bounds the valley of the M&aelig;ander to the
south, bears the Semitic name of Cadmus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the
Eastern;" and at the foot of the range lies the city
of Nino&euml; (Nineveh, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "to dwell.")<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> Again, from one
side the languages of the Phrygians and Lydians are
said to be distinctly different; on the other hand,
most of the Lydian words which have been preserved
to us by the Greeks&mdash;it is true they are not numerous&mdash;can
be traced back to Semitic roots;<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
national genealogy of the Hebrews enumerates Lud
among the sons of Shem, together with Elam, Asshur,
Arphaxad, and Aram. Yet, so far as the Lydian
language allows us to form an opinion, elements of a
different character are not entirely wanting. The
gods Manes and Atys, from whom the first royal
house was derived, and after whom it was named, the
goddess Cybele, whose temple stood at Sardis,<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> do not
belong to the circle of Semitic deities. Manes, as well
as Atys, we found in Phrygia. Hence, looking back
at the connection between the Armenians, Phrygians,
and Thracians, already brought into prominence
we may suppose that the original population of the
river valley of the Hermus was Phrygian, and that
Semitic invaders from the east subjugated these
Phrygians and absorbed them; but not without
adopting on their part some elements of the Phrygian
language and worship.</p>

<p>That a monarchy was in existence among the Lydians
before the first Heracleid ascended the throne cannot be
doubted. In the time of the Heracleids we find
mention made of the descendants of Tylon (<a href="#Page_562">p. 562</a>), a
king who is said to have belonged to the family of the
Atyads. The foundation and fortification of Sardis
also seem to belong to the period before the Heracleids,
the period of the Atyads. Herodotus tells us that the
second dynasty, the supposed descendants of Sandon-Heracles,
gave twenty-two sovereigns to the Lydians,
who ruled over Lydia for 505 years.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> However<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
astonishing the pedigree which Herodotus gives to
these Heracleids (the son of Heracles, Alc&aelig;us, begets
Belus, Belus begets Ninus, and Ninus Agron),<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> we
may regard his statement of the period for which
this dynasty lasted, of which several later members
are established, as historical. And since, after the
Heracleids, the family of Gyges ruled for 140 years
down to the time when Cyrus took Sardis, and since
the taking of Sardis fell in the year 549 <small>B.C.</small>, the
Heracleids must have ascended the throne of Lydia
645 years previously, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the year 1194 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
What degree of civilisation had been reached by the
Lydians about the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small> we can only conclude
from the fact that the Greek settlers on their
coasts found money already coined by the Lydians,
and therefore ascribe to them the invention of the art
of coining.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> The art of dying wool also was, in the
opinion of the Greeks, an invention of the Lydians; and
games at ball as well as at dice were thought to have
been learnt from the Lydians by the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> That
the Greeks made use of the Lydian flute, and subsequently
of the Lydian cithara (both the cithara with
three strings and that with twenty strings), and the
Lydian harmonies to enrich their own music, is an
established fact.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> The Homeric poems describe the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
Lydians (M&aelig;onians) as an "armed equestrian people,"
and mention their trade and wealth.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>North of the Lydians, in the river valleys of the
Ca&iuml;cus Macestus and Rhyndacus, were settled the
Mysians. According to Strabo, they spoke a language
of mixed Phrygian and Lydian elements.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> It was
apparently the Mysian legend which told of king Tantalus,
who possessed the greatest treasures, who slew
his son and offered him for a banquet, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for a sacrifice
to the gods. His grave was shown on Sipylus.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> Before
the Greek colonists took the coasts from them, the
Mysians may have risen to the first elements of
civilisation; but when they were debarred from the
sea, they remained within the limits of their mountains,
pursuing an agricultural and pastoral life.
About the year 500 <small>B.C.</small> their armour was still a small
round shield and javelins, the points of which were
hardened in the fire.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> In spite of these miserable
weapons they gave a good deal of trouble to the
satraps of the Persian king, and even at a later time
desolated the fruitful plains on the coasts by marauding
inroads. Of their worship we only know that the
Greeks found the rites of a god of light on the coasts
at Thymbra, Chryse, and Cilla, who was invoked
under the title Smintheus, a word which is said to
mean the expeller or destroyer of field-mice;<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> and
that a goddess of procreation and fertility was worshipped
on Ida.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> In the Homeric poems it is Aphrodite,
by the side of Apollo, who protects Ilium, and
favours Capys and the sons of Priam in the dells
of Ida.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p>The coast of Asia Minor, to the south of the
Lydians, was in the possession of the Carians. Herodotus
tells us that, according to the legends of the
Cretans, the Carians were, in the most ancient times,
called Leleges, and inhabited the islands of the &AElig;gean
at the time when Minos reigned in Crete. They
were compelled to man the fleet of Minos. A long
time afterwards they were driven out of the islands by
the Ionians and Dorians, and migrated to Asia Minor.
But the Carians themselves maintained that they had
always lived in the land which they possessed.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> We
cannot hesitate to give the preference to the assertion
of the Carians. From the numerous harbours of their
coast they could easily cross to the neighbouring
islands, and thus they could populate Rhodes Samos
and Chios.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Advancing from one to another in the
numerous islands of this sea, they reached the
Cyclades and settled there. The most ancient population
of Crete, called by the Greeks Eteocretes, may
very likely have consisted of Carians only, as is
proved by the position which Greek legend gives to
the Carians in reference to Minos, as well as by other
evidence. This occupation of the islands of the
&AElig;gean Sea by the Carians must be placed about the
year 1500 <small>B.C.</small> For when the Phenicians colonised
these islands in the thirteenth century, they were
occupied by Carians. The Carian population became
dependent on the Phenicians. Subsequently, about
the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, the Hellenes landed on the islands
of the &AElig;gean, and drove out the Carians. The
Carians lost even Samos and Chios; they were again
confined to their old home, and they could not even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
maintain themselves in that, for the best harbours of
their coasts passed into the hands of the Greeks. Yet
the Carians continued to be seamen and pirates. They
lay in wait, as before, for the merchants, and overran
the rich coast land. Even in the seventh century we
meet with Carian pirates and mercenaries, and these
not only on the mouths and banks of the Nile; and
the Chronographers mention, apparently, a hegemony
of the Carians on the sea, which is placed in the
interval from the year 731 to the year 670 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>The Carians had no monarchy embracing the whole
of their territory. But here also, so far as we can
see, princes stood at the head of the various cities. A
kind of confederation united the several places.
About the year 500 we hear of assemblies of Carians
on the banks of the Marsyas near the white pillars,
and afterwards we find common sacrifices of the
Carian cities, and days of meeting in the temple of
Zeus Chrysaor, which was situated in the neighbourhood
of Mylasa (now Milas) at Lagina (now Le&iuml;na).<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
Among the Carians the Greek colonists found a style
of armour superior to their own, and they adopted it.
The "Catalogue of ships," in Homer, represents the
leader of the Carians as going into battle decked with
gold.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> In Alc&aelig;us "the Carian helmet laments," and
Anacreon speaks "of putting the hand upon the well-fitted
Carian haft." Herodotus tells us that the
Greeks learned from the Carians to wear plumes upon
their helmets, to paint devices upon their shields, and
to furnish them with fixed handles,&mdash;in Homer the
shields are carried over the shoulder by straps. Greaves
also are said to have been invented by the Carians.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<p>We are unable to tell with certainty the origin or
the national characteristics of the Carians, though
Herodotus maintains that the Lydians, Mysians, and
Carians spoke the same language. Of the religious
worship of the Carians he tells us that they were the
only nation who worshipped Zeus as a warrior.
Mylasa was the centre of their worship. On the
heights which tower over the plain of Mylasa, in a
forest of plane-trees, near Labranda, lay the temple
of "Zeus Stratius." The image of the god is said to
have carried the double axe. Carian coins of the
fourth century <small>B.C.</small> display the image of a god with a
double axe.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> The same axe is also found on the
remains of Carian altars. The Greeks even maintain
that the god was named after this axe, that his national
name was Labrandeus, and that in Lydian and Carian
<i>labrys</i> meant a battle-axe. Plutarch says:&mdash;Arselis,
the Carian of Mylasa, marched to the aid of Candaules,
king of Lydia (he ruled about the year 700 <small>B.C.</small>), and
afterwards he left the sacred axe of the kings of
Lydia to the god of Labranda.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> This giving up of
the battle-axe to the god of the battle-axe allows us
to suppose that the god of Mylasa is meant by the
Carian of Mylasa; and that Arselis may have been
the name or attribute of this god&mdash;a supposition
which is changed into a certainty by the fact
that in Semitic languages, Chars-el means "axe of
El," "axe of God."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> Beside this warrior Zeus, a warlike
Aphrodite was also worshipped at Mylasa,<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> and if
Strabo calls the goddess of Le&iuml;na Hecate, the reason
of the name may be the death-bringing power of the
goddess Astarte-Ashera. The sacred fish who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
to be found in a pool at Mylasa, with gold rings
round the neck, would then be evidence of the
bountiful, increase-giving side of the nature of this
goddess.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>East of the Carians, on the south coast, in the
valley of the Xanthus, were the settlements of the
Lycians. The range of Taurus, which here rises to a
height of 10,000 feet, sinks down in fields of snow and
Alpine pastures to the course of the Xanthus. The
sides of this valley, Mounts Kragus and Anti-Kragus,
are beautifully wooded, and traversed by sounding
rills. The view extends from the upper course of the
river over the luxuriant vegetation of the plain down
to the sea.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells us that this district was once known
as Milyas, and that the Lycians, who were originally
called Termilians, immigrated from Crete. Sarpedon
and Minos contended for the throne, and as Minos got
the upper hand, Sarpedon went with the Termilians to
Asia, and took possession of Milyas. Afterwards
Lycus, the son of the Attic king Pandion, when driven
out by his brother Aegeus, came to Sarpedon, and
from him the Termilians got the name of Lycians.
Their laws were Cretan and Carian. They wore hats
adorned with feathers, goat skins round their
shoulders, sickle-shaped swords and daggers, coats of
mail, greaves, bows, and arrows of reeds. They were
named after the mother, and not after the father, and
spoke of the mothers of their mothers as their ancestors.
The son of a free woman and a slave was free and
passed for a well-born man; but if a free man, even
the first among them, begot children with a foreign
woman or a concubine, these were outlaws.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> Heraclides
of Pontus extends these statements so far as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
assert that the Lycians from ancient times had been
under the dominion of their wives; Nicolaus, of
Damascus tells us that the daughters of the Lycians,
and not the sons, took the inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>In the Homeric poems, Pr&#339;tus, king of Argos,
sends Bellerophontes of Ephyra (Corinth) to the king
of the Lycians, to be put to death. The king bade
him slay the Chim&aelig;ra, a monster which was a lion in
front, a goat in the middle part, and a dragon behind,
and when he succeeded in this he sent him to
fight against the Solymi and the Amazons. But
afterwards he gave him half his kingdom and his
daughter, who bore him Hippolochus and Laodameia.
The son of Hippolochus was Glaucus, and the son of
Laodameia was Sarpedon, the chieftains who led the
Lycians to the aid of the Trojans.</p>

<p>Beside the supposed immigration of the Lycians
from Crete and the poetry of Homer we know nothing
of the history of the Lycians beyond the fact that they
did not submit to the army of Cyrus without a most
obstinate resistance. And even under the supremacy
of the Persians the Lycians managed their internal
affairs independently. They formed a federation
which was in existence at Strabo's time, and then
included twenty-three places. Each city was represented
at the assembly; the six larger cities had three
votes each, the next largest had two, and the smaller
cities had one.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>The name Milyas, which, according to Herodotus,
was borne by the valley of the Xanthus, clung even in
later times to the spur under the ridge of Mount
Taurus, which runs out eastward towards Mount
Solyma. Hence the Lycians could easily be repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>sented
as in conflict with the Solymi. The name
Chim&aelig;ra is given to a high mountain valley on
Mount Kragus.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> If the Greeks call the inhabitants
of the valley of the Xanthus Lycians, the name has
not arisen among them from the supposed Lycus, the
brother of &AElig;geus, but rather from the Grecian god
of light, Apollo Lyceus. According to the mythus of
the Greeks, Apollo Bellerophontes (who was worshipped
at Corinth), dashes down from his cloud-horse and
with his crown of rays breaks through the thick clouds
which obscure the sun; he overcomes Bellerus, the
spirit of darkness. In the mind of the Greeks, Lycia
was free from the clouds of winter; and, as a fact, the
climate of the valley of the Xanthus is excellent. Into
this bright land, therefore, the god was thought to
have marched when he had become a hero; here he
overcame the Chim&aelig;ra, the creature of mist and
cloud. The Greeks went still further in this conception.
The east, the land of sunrise, was in itself the
land of light, of the god of light, Lyceus. The god
of light was thought to pass the winter in the
brighter east, in the home of the sun. When the
Greek colonists had settled on the western coasts of
Asia Minor, they regarded the valley of the Xanthus
as the eastern land of light, they gave it this name,
and supposed that Apollo passed the winter in Lycia,
and gave oracles during the six winter months at
Patara in Lycia.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> In spite of the eastern situation
and the climate of Lycia, this idea would hardly have
taken root had not the Lycians at Patara, and probably
at other places in Lycia, worshipped a god in whom
the Greeks could recognise their own god of light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
The Homeric poems place the Lycians in the closest
connection with the Teucrians. There is a Xanthus
in Lycia and in the Troad, and the name Tros seems
to be identical with the name of the Lycian city of
Tlos, which lies high up in the valley of the Xanthus
under Taurus. In any case, from this close combination
of the Teucrians and Lycians in Homer, we may
conclude that with the Greeks of the coast the
Lycians passed for a tribe who had already been for a
long time in possession of their settlements. None
but native Asiatic tribes could be represented as
fighting beside the native Teucrians as their closest
confederates.</p>

<p>The Lycians developed a peculiar civilisation and
a peculiar art, of which numerous monuments, and
many of them accompanied by inscriptions, have
come down to us. The alphabet in these inscriptions
closely resembles the Greek. With the aid of
some inscriptions written in the Greek and Lycian
languages, scholars have succeeded in fixing the value
of the Lycian letters&mdash;of which there are ten for
vowels and diphthongs, and twenty for consonants.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>
By this means we have become acquainted with the
name by which the Lycians called themselves. They
were not merely called Termilians, as Herodotus supposed,
in the most ancient times, but even in their own
inscriptions they call themselves Tramele. The city
which the Greeks calls Xanthus is in the language of
the Tramele, Arna; the city of Patara is Pttarazu;
Pegasa is Begssere.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> In fixing the character of the
Lycian language, it was at first supposed that the
Lycians might have been a branch of the Phrygians,
who had forced their way over the Taurus to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
south coast&mdash;an assumption which seems to be supported
by the fact that the Lycian monuments
resemble the Phrygian in plan and style; and that
the Lycians, like the Phrygians, loved to excavate
walls of rock and that in Lycia, as in Phrygia,
the influence of the Greeks was felt at an early time.
But the Lycian idiom, so far as the remains of it have
been examined at present, was distinctly different
from the Phrygian language. While some of our
scholars find in the Lycian language words and inflexions
allied to the Albanian, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the remains
of the language of the ancient Illyrians, others are
more inclined to place the Lycian in close connection
with the Iranian languages.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> In either case the
Lycians, like the Armenians and Phrygians, belong to
the Indo-Germanic stock, and not only the Armenians
and Phrygians, but along with them the forefathers
of the Lycians came into Asia Minor from the north-east.</p>

<p>The Lycians were settled in a region of strong
natural boundaries, and of a very defined and picturesque
form. The position of their land, protected
as it was by strong natural boundaries, secured for
them a more undisturbed development than was
possible to the other tribes of Asia Minor. Their
cities and towers, Xanthus, Phellus, Myra, Telmissus,
Patara, Pinara, and Tlos were surrounded by strong
walls of Cyclopian architecture, and the splendid
remains are evidence of great skill in masonry. The
noble ruins of Xanthus, not far from the mouth of
the river of the same name, still proclaim, even at a
distance, the ancient metropolis of the Lycians. How
far back the monuments of Lycia extend cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
determined as yet. The oldest of which the date
can be fixed go back to the reign of Darius II., the
Itariayush of Lycian inscriptions. The reliefs exhibit
the Chim&aelig;ra, as described in Homer; and they repeatedly
exhibit a lion slaying a bull.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> The Lycians
themselves are represented in long garments, just as
in works of Greek art; and even to this day the
peasants on the Xanthus are to be seen in the caftan.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>
Pictures of battles, of agricultural and pastoral occupations
are frequent on the monuments; but so far as
the inscriptions have been deciphered at present, they
afford no single instance in support of the statement
of Herodotus that the Lycians were not named after
the father, but after the mother.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> The most important
remains are the tombs, which are evidence of the great
industry and care which the Lycians devoted to the
repose and memory of the dead. A considerable
number of these tombs lie within the walls of the
city, and are surrounded by the ruins of other
buildings. Hence the dwellings of the dead and of
the living were not separated among the Lycians.
Besides sarcophagi, made of blocks brought for the
purpose, we also find detached rocks, which are
changed into great sarcophagi, rocky peaks transformed
into sepulchres, and extensive walls of rock,
in which grave-chambers have been cut. The face of
the rocky wall, thus hollowed out for tombs, is provided
with fa&ccedil;ades which rise up in rich variety to
the number of many thousands, over and alongside of
each other, sometimes advancing, sometimes receding,
according to the nature of the rock. The style of
these tombs, which is for the most part very delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
and slender, is an imitation of a kind of wooden structure,
which must have been common in Lycia in
ancient times, and the simplest forms of which are
still in use among the peasants of the region which
corresponds to Lycia;<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> sometimes the structure is
simpler, at others more complicated, and the effect is
strengthened by delicate and luxuriant ornamentation.
The faces of the rock-tombs sometimes end with a flat
framework of beams, at others with a gable in low
relief.  The detached sepulchres exhibit the same
imitation of a wooden building. Many of these
sepulchres are obviously intended for three corpses;
in the single chamber included in them are generally
found two stone benches in the sides and at the back
a receptacle for a corpse in a recess.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> The detached
sarcophagi are the most numerous. On a sub-structure,
or immediately on the ground, stands a long
stone coffin, closed by a high massive cover, the
section of which exhibits a Gothic pointed arch. On
these sarcophagi also the ornamentation is almost
always rich, and carried out with neatness even to
the smallest detail. Beside the sarcophagi we also
find pillars and obelisks among the ruins. The tympana,
friezes, and surfaces of all these monuments are
covered with reliefs, which represent with much
truth and liveliness the life of animals as well as
the life of men. Evident remains of colouring on all
the monuments show us that a layer of lively and even
startling colours was laid upon these buildings. The
reliefs also were painted, and some are treated almost
as pictures. The inscriptions upon the tombs prove
that the Lycians erected these tombs in their lifetime
for themselves, wives, and children, and that this was
done by several families in common; they invoke the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
anger of a goddess Phate&mdash;whom the Greeks call Leto&mdash;on
those who might dare to violate them. From
the nature and solidity of these tombs and sarcophagi,
it is clear that the Lycians were almost at as much
trouble to give a secure resting-place to their dead as
the Egyptians were to give rest to their mummies,
while the ornaments show that the Lycians must have
regarded the life after death as a state of peaceful
repose; the sculptures on the tombs invariably represent
friendly scenes of family life, of occupation in
the country, of social life or festal enjoyment. We
see mothers with their children, carriage journeys,
riders, processions, banquets, and feasts, and finally
battle-pieces, in which the combatants are partly
armed as Lycians and partly as Greeks. Nothing,
not even in the pictures of battles, reminds us of the
horrors of death, or of a judgment in the under
world. The monuments of Lycia prove that the
supremacy of the Persians did not interrupt the progress
of Lycian art. But the creations of the later
period enable us to see that Greek art, in her
bloom, obtained and exercised the strongest influence
over the Lycians. The most beautiful monument of
Lycia, the tomb of Harpagus, the Persian satrap,
which belongs to the first half of the fourth century,
exhibits a preponderance of Greek forms.</p>

follows the Catonian era), "tunc etiam Amazonum gentis et Cimmeriorum
in Asiam repentinus incursus plurimam diu lateque vastationem et stragem
edidit." Grote ("History of Greece," 3, 334) objects that if this statement
is allowed to hold good for the Cimmerians, we are justified in making the
same conclusions for the Amazons, who would thus become historical.
The Amazons are connected with the Cimmerians because the land round
Sinope was the abode of the Cimmerians, and it was in this place that
the Amazons were said to have dwelt. I too should be inclined to give
the less weight to the testimony of Orosius, as the number 30 may be a
corruption for 300. But the other evidence given is enough to prove that
the Cimmerians immigrated into Asia Minor in the period between 750
and 700 <small>B.C.</small>, and settled round the Halys at the mouth of the river.</p></div>

Justinus (2, 4), as remarked, represents Ilinus, and Skolopitus, as making
their way from Scythia to the Thermodon, and when these Scythians had
for many years plundered their neighbours from this centre, they were attacked
and cut down by the conspirators among their neighbours. Their
wives remained; they seized the weapons, and founded a female kingdom.
In order to preserve the race, they came together with the neighbouring
people, but they slew all the male children. Marpesia and Lampedo, who
called themselves daughters of Mars, ruled over this female kingdom.
Then Lampedo with a part of the Amazons marched out and founded
Ephesus, and many other cities; over those who remained behind, when
Marpesia was slain, Antiope and Oreithyia reigned; and in their time
Heracles and Theseus came and carried off two sisters of Antiope. To
avenge this act Oreithyia marched against Athens, supported by the
Scythian king Sagillus, and his son Panasagorus. After Oreithyia, Penthesilea
reigned; after her reign the power of the Amazons declined. Cf. Steph.
Byzant, <i>s. v.</i> &#7944;&#956;&#945;&#950;&#972;&#957;&#949;&#962;,
where the story which Herodotus (4, 1-4) tells of
the returning Scythians of Madyas is turned to the advantage of the Amazons.</p></div>

<p>"A work of the very highest merit; its
learning is exact and profound; its narrative
full of genius and skill; its descriptions of
men are admirably vivid. We wish to place
on record our opinion that Dr. Mommsen's is
by far the best history of the Decline and
Fall of the Roman Commonwealth."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>"Since the days of Niebuhr, no work on
Roman History has appeared that combines
so much to attract, instruct, and charm the
reader. Its style&mdash;a rare quality in a German
author&mdash;is vigorous, spirited, and animated.
Professor Mommsen's work can stand a comparison
with the noblest productions of modern
history."&mdash;<i>Dr. Schmitz.</i></p>

<p>"This is the best history of the Roman
Republic, taking the work on the whole; the
author's complete mastery of his subject, the
variety of his gifts and acquirements, his
graphic power in the delineation of natural
and individual character, and the vivid interest
which he inspires in every portion of
his book. He is without an equal in his own
sphere. The work may be read in the translation
(executed with the sanction of the
author) not only with instruction, but with
great pleasure."&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p>

<p>"A book of deepest interest, and which
ought to be translated."&mdash;<i>Dean Trench.</i></p>

<p>"Beyond all doubt to be ranked among
those really great historical works which do
so much honour to our own day. We can
have little hesitation in pronouncing this
work to be the best complete Roman History
in existence. In short, we have now, for the
first time, the complete history of the Roman
Republic, really written in a way worthy of
the greatness of the subject. Dr. Mommson
is a real historian; his powers of research
and judgment are of a very high order; he is
skilful in the grasp of his whole subject, and
vigorous and independent in his way of dealing
with particular questions. And an English
critic may be allowed to add, that his book
is far easier and more pleasant to read than
many of the productions of his fellow-countrymen."&mdash;<i>National
Review.</i></p>

<p>"An original work, from the pen of a
master. The style is nervous and lively,
and its vigour fully sustained. This English
translation fills up a gap in our literature.
It will give the school-boy and the older
student of antiquity a history of Rome up to
the mark of present German scholarship, and
at the same time serve as a sample of historical
inquiry for all ages and all lands."&mdash;<i>Westminster
Review.</i></p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
